<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><b>HIS</b> work was originally constructed, and in previous editions
appeared, in the form of Lectures. The only vestiges of that form, in
its present shape, are certain modes of expression. The language
retains the character of an address by a speaker to his hearers; being
more familiar, direct, and personal than is ordinarily employed in the
relations of an author to a reader.</p>

<p>The former work was prepared under circumstances which prevented a
thorough investigation of the subject. Leisure and freedom from
professional duties have now enabled me to prosecute the researches
necessary to do justice to it.</p>

<p>The &quot;Lectures on Witchcraft,&quot; published in 1831, have long been out of
print. Although frequently importuned to prepare a new edition, I was
unwilling to issue again what I had discovered to be an insufficient
presentation of the subject. In the mean time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[i.viii]</a></span> it constantly became
more and more apparent, that much injury was resulting from the want
of a complete and correct view of a transaction so often referred to,
and universally misunderstood.</p>

<p>The first volume of this work contains what seems to me necessary to
prepare the reader for the second, in which the incidents and
circumstances connected with the witchcraft prosecutions in 1692, at
the village and in the town of Salem, are reduced to chronological
order, and exhibited in detail.</p>

<p>As showing how far the beliefs of the understanding, the perceptions
of the senses, and the delusions of the imagination, may be
confounded, the subject belongs not only to theology and moral and
political science, but to physiology, in its original and proper use,
as embracing our whole nature; and the facts presented may help to
conclusions relating to what is justly regarded as the great mystery
of our being,&#8212;the connection between the body and the mind.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to mention the various well-known works of authority
and illustration, as they are referred to in the text. But I cannot
refrain from bearing my grateful testimony to the value of the
&quot;Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society&quot; and the
&quot;New-England Historical and Genealogical Register.&quot; The &quot;Historical
Collections&quot; and the &quot;Proceedings&quot; of the Essex Institute have
afforded me inestimable assistance. Such works as these are providing
the materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[i.ix]</a></span> that will secure to our country a history such as no
other nation can have. Our first age will not be shrouded in darkness
and consigned to fable, but, in all its details, brought within the
realm of knowledge. Every person who desires to preserve the memory of
his ancestors, and appreciate the elements of our institutions and
civilization, ought to place these works, and others like them, on the
shelves of his library, in an unbroken and continuing series. A debt
of gratitude is due to the earnest, laborious, and disinterested
students who are contributing the results of their explorations to the
treasures of antiquarian and genealogical learning which accumulate in
these publications.</p>

<p>A source of investigation, especially indispensable in the preparation
of the present work, deserves to be particularly noticed. In 1647, the
General Court of Massachusetts provided by law for the taking of
testimony, in all cases, under certain regulations, in the form of
depositions, to be preserved <i>in perpetuam rei memoriam</i>. The evidence
of witnesses was prepared in writing, beforehand, to be used at the
trials; they to be present at the time, to meet further inquiry, if
living within ten miles, and not unavoidably prevented. In a capital
case, the presence of the witness, as well as his written testimony,
was absolutely required. These depositions were lodged in the files,
and constitute the most valuable materials of history. In our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[i.x]</a></span> day,
the statements of witnesses ordinarily live only in the memory of
persons present at the trials, and are soon lost in oblivion. In cases
attracting unusual interest, stenographers are employed to furnish
them to the press. There were no newspaper reporters or &quot;court
calendars&quot; in the early colonial times; but these depositions more
than supply their place. Given in, as they were, in all sorts of
cases,&#8212;of wills, contracts, boundaries and encroachments, assault and
battery, slander, larceny, &amp;c., they let us into the interior, the
very inmost recesses, of life and society in all their forms. The
extent to which, by the aid of <span class="smcap">William P. Upham</span>, Esq., of
Salem, I have drawn from this source is apparent at every page.</p>

<p>A word is necessary to be said relating to the originals of the
documents that belong to the witchcraft proceedings. They were
probably all deposited at the time in the clerk's office of Essex
County. A considerable number of them were, from some cause,
transferred to the State archives, and have been carefully preserved.
Of the residue, a very large proportion have been abstracted from time
to time by unauthorized hands, and many, it is feared, destroyed or
otherwise lost. Two very valuable parcels have found their way into
the libraries of the Massachusetts Historical Society and the Essex
Institute, where they are faithfully secured. A few others have come
to light among papers in the possession of individuals. It is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[i.xi]</a></span>
hoped, that, if any more should be found, they will be lodged in some
public institution; so that, if thought best, they may all be
collected, arranged, and placed beyond wear, tear, and loss, in the
perpetual custody of type.</p>

<p>The papers remaining in the office of the clerk of this county were
transcribed into a volume a few years since; the copyist supplying,
conjecturally, headings to the several documents. Although he executed
his work in an elegant manner, and succeeded in giving correctly many
documents hard to be deciphered, such errors, owing to the condition
of the papers, occurred in arranging them, transcribing their
contents, and framing their headings, that I have had to resort to the
originals throughout.</p>

<p>As the object of this work is to give to the reader of the present day
an intelligible view of a transaction of the past, and not to
illustrate any thing else than the said transaction, no attempt has
been made to preserve the orthography of that period. Most of the
original papers were written without any expectation that they would
ever be submitted to inspection in print; many of them by plain
country people, without skill in the structure of sentences, or regard
to spelling; which, in truth, was then quite unsettled. It is no
uncommon thing to find the same word spelled differently in the same
document. It is very questionable whether it is expedient or just to
perpetuate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[i.xii]</a></span> blemishes, often the result of haste or carelessness,
arising from mere inadvertence. In some instances, where the interest
of the passage seemed to require it, the antique style is preserved.
In no case is a word changed or the structure altered; but the now
received spelling is generally adopted, and the punctuation made to
express the original sense.</p>

<p>It is indeed necessary, in what claims to be an exact reprint of an
old work, to imitate its orthography precisely, even at the expense of
difficulty in apprehending at once the meaning, and of perpetuating
errors of carelessness and ignorance. Such modern reproductions are
valuable, and have an interest of their own. They deserve the favor of
all who desire to examine critically, and in the most authentic form,
publications of which the original copies are rare, and the earliest
editions exhausted. The enlightened and enterprising publishers who
are thus providing facsimiles of old books and important documents of
past ages ought to be encouraged and rewarded by a generous public.
But the present work does not belong to that class, or make any
pretensions of that kind.</p>

<p>My thanks are especially due to the Hon. <span class="smcap">Asahel Huntington</span>,
clerk of the courts in Essex County, for his kindness in facilitating
the use of the materials in his office; to the Hon. <span class="smcap">Oliver
Warner</span>, secretary of the Commonwealth, and the officers of his
department; and to <span class="smcap">Stephen N. Gifford</span>, Esq., clerk of the
Senate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[i.xiii]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">David Pulsifer</span>, Esq., in the office of the Secretary of
State, is well known for his pre-eminent skill and experience in
mastering the chirography of the primitive colonial times, and
elucidating its peculiarities. He has been unwearied in his labors,
and most earnest in his efforts, to serve me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Samuel G. Drake</span>, who has so largely illustrated our
history and explored its sources, has, by spontaneous and considerate
acts of courtesy rendered me important help. Similar expressions of
friendly interest by Mr. <span class="smcap">William B. Towne</span>, of Brookline,
Mass.; Hon. J. <span class="smcap">Hammond Trumbull</span>, of Hartford, Conn.; and
<span class="smcap">George H. Moore</span>, Esq., of New-York City,&#8212;are gratefully
acknowledged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Samuel P. Fowler</span>, Esq., of Danvers, generously placed at my
disposal his valuable stores of knowledge relating to the subject. The
officers in charge of the original papers, in the Historical Society
and the Essex Institute, have allowed me to examine and use them.</p>

<p>I cordially express my acknowledgments to the Hon. <span class="smcap">Benjamin F.
Browne</span>, of Salem, who, retired from public life and the cares of
business, is giving the leisure of his venerable years to the
collection, preservation, and liberal contribution of an unequalled
amount of knowledge respecting our local antiquities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles W. Palfray</span>, Esq., while attending the General Court
as a Representative of Salem, in 1866,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[i.xiv]</a></span> gave me the great benefit of
his explorations among the records and papers in the State House.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moses Prince</span>, of Danvers Centre, is an embodiment of the
history, genealogy, and traditions of that locality, and has taken an
active and zealous interest in the preparation of this work.
<span class="smcap">Andrew Nichols</span>, Esq., of Danvers, and the family of the late
Colonel <span class="smcap">Perley Putnam</span>, of Salem, also rendered me much aid.</p>

<p>I am indebted to <span class="smcap">Charles Davis</span>, Esq., of Beverly, for the use
of the record-book of the church, composed of &quot;the brethren and
sisters belonging to Bass River,&quot; gathered Sept. 20, 1667, now the
First Church of Beverly; and to <span class="smcap">James Hill</span>, Esq., town-clerk
of that place, for access to the records in his charge.</p>

<p>To <span class="smcap">Gilbert Tapley</span>, Esq., chairman of the committee of the
parish, and <span class="smcap">Augustus Mudge</span>, Esq., its clerk, and to the Rev.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rice</span>, pastor of the church, at Danvers Centre, I cannot
adequately express my obligations. Without the free use of the
original parish and church record-books with which they intrusted me,
and having them constantly at hand, I could not have begun adequately
to tell the story of Salem Village or the Witchcraft Delusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <a href="#map">map</a>, based upon various local maps and the Coast-Survey chart, is
the result of much personal exploration and perambulation of the
ground. It may claim to be a very exact representation of many of the
original grants and farms. The locality of the houses, mills, and
bridges, in 1692, is given in some cases precisely, and in all with
near approximation. The task has been a difficult one. An original
plot of Governor Endicott's Ipswich River grant, No. III., is in the
State House, and one of the Swinnerton grant, No. XIX., in the Salem
town-books. Neither of them, however, affords elements by which to
establish its exact location. A plot of the Townsend Bishop grant, No.
XX., as its boundaries were finally determined, is in the State House,
and another of the same in the court-files of the county. This gives
one fixed and known point, Hadlock's Bridge, from which, following the
lines by points of compass and distances, as indicated on the plot and
described in the Colonial Records, all the sides of the grant are laid
out with accuracy, and its place on the <a href="#map">map</a> determined with absolute
certainty. A very perfect and scientifically executed plan of a part
of the boundary between Salem and Reading in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[i.xvi]</a></span> 1666 is in the State
House; of which an exact tracing was kindly furnished by Mr. <span class="smcap">H.J.
Coolidge</span>, of the Secretary of State's office. It gives two of the
sides of the Governor Bellingham grant, No. IV., in such a manner as
to afford the means of projecting it with entire certainty, and fixing
its locality. There are no other plots of original or early grants or
farms on this territory; but, starting from the Bishop and Bellingham
grants thus laid out in their respective places, by a collation of
deeds of conveyance and partition on record, with the aid of portions
of the primitive stone-walls still remaining, and measurements resting
on permanent objects, the entire region has been reduced to a
demarkation comprehending the whole area. The locations of
then-existing roads have been obtained from the returns of laying-out
committees, and other evidence in the records and files. The
construction of the <a href="#map">map</a>, in all its details, is the result of the
researches and labors of <span class="smcap">W.P. Upham</span>.</p>

<p>The <a href="salem2-htm.html#warrant">death-warrant</a> is a photograph by <span class="smcap">E.R. Perkins</span>, of Salem.
The original, among the papers on file in the office of the clerk of
the courts of Essex County, having always been regarded as a great
curiosity, has been subjected to constant handling, and become much
obscured by dilapidation. The letters, and in some instances entire
words, at the end of the lines, are worn off. To preserve it, if
possible, from further injury, it has been pasted on cloth. Owing to
this circumstance, and the yellowish hue to which the paper has faded,
it does not take favorably by photograph; but the exactness of
imitation, which can only thus be obtained with absolute certainty, is
more important than any other consideration. Only so much as contains
the body of the warrant, the sheriff's <a href="salem2-htm.html#return">return</a>, and the seal, are
given.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[i.xvii]</a></span> The tattered margins are avoided, as they reveal the cloth,
and impair the antique aspect of the document. The original is slowly
disintegrating and wasting away, notwithstanding the efforts to
preserve it; and its appearance, as seen to-day, can only be
perpetuated in photograph. The warrant is reduced about one-third, and
the return one-half.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p><span class="dropcap">&#160;I</span><b>T</b> is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the human being,
that he loves to contemplate the scenes of the past, and desires to
have his own history borne down to the future. This, like all the
other propensities of our nature, is accompanied by faculties to
secure its gratification. The gift of speech, by which the parent can
convey information to the child&#8212;the old transmit intelligence to the
young&#8212;is an indication that it is the design of the Author of our
being that we should receive from those passing away the narrative of
their experience, and communicate the results of our own to the
generations that succeed us. All nations have, to a greater or less
degree, been faithful to their trust in using the gift to fulfil the
design of the Giver. It is impossible to name a people who do not
possess cherished traditions that have descended from their early
ancestors.</p>

<p>Although it is generally considered that the invention of a system of
arbitrary and external signs to communicate thought is one of the
greatest and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[i.2]</a></span> arduous achievements of human ingenuity, yet so
universal is the disposition to make future generations acquainted
with our condition and history,&#8212;a disposition the efficient cause of
which can only be found in a sense of the value of such
knowledge,&#8212;that you can scarcely find a people on the face of the
globe, who have not contrived, by some means or other, from the rude
monument of shapeless rock to the most perfect alphabetical language,
to communicate with posterity; thus declaring, as with the voice of
Nature herself, that it is desirable and proper that all men should
know as much as possible of the character, actions, and fortunes of
their predecessors on the stage of life.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to discern the end for which this disposition to
preserve for the future and contemplate the past was imparted to us.
If all that we knew were what is taught by our individual experience,
our minds would have but little, comparatively, to exercise and expand
them, and our characters would be the result of the limited influences
embraced within the narrow sphere of our particular and immediate
relations and circumstances. But, as our notice is extended in the
observation of those who have lived before us, our materials for
reflection and sources of instruction are multiplied. The virtues we
admire in our ancestors not only adorn and dignify their names, but
win us to their imitation. Their prosperity and happiness spread
abroad a diffusive light that reaches us, and brightens our condition.
The wisdom that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[i.3]</a></span> guided their footsteps becomes, at the same time, a
lamp to our path. The observation of the errors of their course, and
of the consequent disappointments and sufferings that befell them,
enables us to pass in safety through rocks and ledges on which they
were shipwrecked; and, while we grieve to see them eating the bitter
fruits of their own ignorance and folly as well as vices and crimes,
we can seize the benefit of their experience without paying the price
at which they purchased it.</p>

<p>In the desire which every man feels to learn the history, and be
instructed by the example, of his predecessors, and in the
accompanying disposition, with the means of carrying it into effect,
to transmit a knowledge of himself and his own times to his
successors, we discover the wise and admirable arrangement of a
providence which removes the worn-out individual to a better country,
but leaves the acquisitions of his mind and the benefit of his
experience as an accumulating and common fund for the use of his
posterity; which has secured the continued renovation of the race,
without the loss of the wisdom of each generation.</p>

<p>These considerations suggest the true definition of history. It is the
instrument by which the results of the great experiment of human
action on this theatre of being are collected and transmitted from age
to age. Speaking through the records of history, the generations that
have gone warn and guide the generations that follow. History is the
Past, teaching Philosophy to the Present, for the Future.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[i.4]</a></span></p>

<p>Since this is the true and proper design of history, it assumes an
exalted station among the branches of human knowledge. Every community
that aspires to become intelligent and virtuous should cherish it.
Institutions for the promotion and diffusion of useful information
should have special reference to it. And all people should be induced
to look back to the days of their forefathers, to be warned by their
errors, instructed by their wisdom, and stimulated in the career of
improvement by the example of their virtues.</p>

<p>The historian would find a great amount and variety of materials in
the annals of this old town,&#8212;greater, perhaps, than in any other of
its grade in the country. But there is one chapter in our history of
pre-eminent interest and importance. The witchcraft delusion of 1692
has attracted universal attention since the date of its occurrence,
and will, in all coming ages, render the name of Salem notable
throughout the world. Wherever the place we live in is mentioned, this
memorable transaction will be found associated with it; and those who
know nothing else of our history or our character will be sure to
know, and tauntingly to inform us that they know, that we hanged the
witches.</p>

<p>It is surely incumbent upon us to possess ourselves of correct and
just views of a transaction thus indissolubly connected with the
reputation of our home, with the memory of our fathers, and, of
course, with the most precious part of the inheritance of our
chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[i.5]</a></span>dren. I am apprehensive that the community is very superficially
acquainted with this transaction. All have heard of the Salem
witchcraft; hardly any are aware of the real character of that event.
Its mention creates a smile of astonishment, and perhaps a sneer of
contempt, or, it may be, a thrill of horror for the innocent who
suffered; but there is reason to fear, that it fails to suggest those
reflections, and impart that salutary instruction, without which the
design of Providence in permitting it to take place cannot be
accomplished. There are, indeed, few passages in the history of any
people to be compared with it in all that constitutes the pitiable and
tragical, the mysterious and awful. The student of human nature will
contemplate in its scenes one of the most remarkable developments
which that nature ever assumed; while the moralist, the statesman, and
the Christian philosopher will severally find that it opens widely
before them a field fruitful in instruction.</p>

<p>Our ancestors have been visited with unmeasured reproach for their
conduct on the occasion. Sad, indeed, was the delusion that came over
them, and shocking the extent to which their bewildered imaginations
and excited passions hurried and drove them on. Still, however, many
considerations deserve to be well weighed before sentence is passed
upon them. And while I hope to give evidence of a readiness to have
every thing appear in its own just light, and to expose to view the
very darkest features of the transaction, I am confident of being able
to bring forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[i.6]</a></span> such facts and reflections as will satisfy you that
no reproach ought to be attached to them, in consequence of this
affair, which does not belong, at least equally, to all other nations,
and to the greatest and best men of their times and of previous ages;
and, in short, that the final predominating sentiment their conduct
should awaken is not so much that of anger and indignation as of pity
and compassion.</p>

<p>Let us endeavor to carry ourselves back to the state of the colony of
Massachusetts one hundred and seventy years ago. The persecutions our
ancestors had undergone in their own country, and the privations,
altogether inconceivable by us, they suffered during the early years
of their residence here, acting upon their minds and characters, in
co-operation with the influences of the political and ecclesiastical
occurrences that marked the seventeenth century, had imparted a
gloomy, solemn, and romantic turn to their dispositions and
associations, which was transmitted without diminution to their
children, strengthened and aggravated by their peculiar circumstances.
It was the triumphant age of superstition. The imagination had been
expanded by credulity, until it had reached a wild and monstrous
growth. The Puritans were always prone to subject themselves to its
influence; and New England, at the time to which we are referring, was
a most fit and congenial theatre upon which to display its power.
Cultivation had made but a slight encroachment on the wilderness.
Wide, dark, unexplored forests covered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[i.7]</a></span> hills, hung over the
lonely roads, and frowned upon the scattered settlements. Persons
whose lives have been passed where the surface has long been opened,
and the land generally cleared, little know the power of a primitive
wilderness upon the mind. There is nothing more impressive than its
sombre shadows and gloomy recesses. The solitary wanderer is ever and
anon startled by the strange, mysterious sounds that issue from its
hidden depths. The distant fall of an ancient and decayed trunk, or
the tread of animals as they prowl over the mouldering branches with
which the ground is strown; the fluttering of unseen birds brushing
through the foliage, or the moaning of the wind sweeping over the
topmost boughs,&#8212;these all tend to excite the imagination and
solemnize the mind. But the stillness of a forest is more startling
and awe-inspiring than its sounds. Its silence is so deep as itself to
become audible to the inner soul. It is not surprising that wooded
countries have been the fruitful fountains and nurseries of
superstition.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;In such a place as this, at such an hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ancestry can be in aught believed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descending spirits have conversed with man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told the secrets of the world unknown.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The forests which surrounded our ancestors were the abode of a
mysterious race of men of strange demeanor and unascertained origin.
The aspects they presented, the stories told of them, and every thing
connected with them, served to awaken fear, bewilder the imagination,
and aggravate the tendencies of the general condition of things to
fanatical enthusiasm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[i.8]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the common belief, sanctioned, as will appear in the course of
this discussion, not by the clergy alone, but by the most learned
scholars of that and the preceding ages, that the American Indians
were the subjects and worshippers of the Devil, and their powwows,
wizards.</p>

<p>In consequence of this opinion, the entire want of confidence and
sympathy to which it gave rise, and the provocations naturally
incident to two races of men, of dissimilar habits, feelings, and
ideas, thrown into close proximity, a state of things was soon brought
about which led to conflicts and wars of the most distressing and
shocking character. A strongly rooted sentiment of hostility and
horror became associated in the minds of the colonists with the name
of Indian. There was scarcely a village where the marks of savage
violence and cruelty could not be pointed out, or an individual whose
family history did not contain some illustration of the stealth, the
malice or the vengeance of the savage foe. In 1689, John Bishop, and
Nicholas Reed a servant of Edward Putnam; and, in 1690, Godfrey
Sheldon, were killed by Indians in Salem. In the year 1691, about six
months previous to the commencement of the witchcraft delusion, the
county of Essex was ordered to keep twenty-four scouts constantly in
the field, to guard the frontiers against the savage enemy, and to
give notice of his approach, then looked for every hour with the
greatest alarm and apprehension.</p>

<p>Events soon justified the dread of Indian hostilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[i.9]</a></span> felt by the
people of this neighborhood. Within six years after the witchcraft
delusion, incursions of the savage foe took place at various points,
carrying terror to all hearts. In August, 1696, they killed or took
prisoners fifteen persons at Billerica, burning many houses. In
October of the same year, they came upon Newbury, and carried off and
tomahawked nine persons; all of whom perished, except a lad who
survived his wounds. In 1698, they made a murderous and destructive
assault upon Haverhill. The story of the capture, sufferings, and
heroic achievements of Hannah Dustin, belongs to the history of this
event. It stands by the side of the immortal deed of Judith, and has
no other parallel in all the annals of female daring and prowess. On
the 3d of July, 1706, a garrison was stormed at night in Dunstable;
and Holyoke, a son of Edward Putnam, with three other soldiers, was
killed. He was twenty-two years of age. In 1708, seven hundred
Algonquin and St. Francis Indians, under the command of French
officers, fell again upon Haverhill about break of day, on the 29th of
August; consigned the town to conflagration and plunder; destroyed a
large amount of property; massacred the minister Mr. Rolfe, the
commander of the post Captain Wainwright, together with nearly forty
others; and carried off many into captivity. On this occasion, a troop
of horse and a foot company from Salem Village rushed to the rescue;
the then minister of the parish, the Rev. Joseph Green, seized his gun
and went with them. They pursued the flying Indians for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[i.10]</a></span> some
distance. So deeply were the people of Haverhill impressed by the
valor and conduct of Mr. Green and his people, that they sent a letter
of thanks, and desired him to come and preach to them. He complied
with the invitation, spent a Sunday there, and thus gave them an
opportunity to express personally their gratitude. On other occasions,
he accompanied his people on similar expeditions.</p>

<p>These occurrences show that the fears and anxieties of the colonists
in reference to Indian assaults were not without grounds at the period
of the witchcraft delusion. They were, at that very time, hanging like
a storm-cloud over their heads, soon to burst, and spread death and
destruction among them.</p>

<p>There was but little communication between the several villages and
settlements. To travel from Boston to Salem, for instance, which the
ordinary means of conveyance enable us to do at present in less than
an hour, was then the fatiguing, adventurous, and doubtful work of an
entire day.</p>

<p>It was the darkest and most desponding period in the civil history of
New England. The people, whose ruling passion then was, as it has ever
since been, a love for constitutional rights, had, a few years before,
been thrown into dismay by the loss of their charter, and, from that
time, kept in a feverish state of anxiety respecting their future
political destinies. In addition to all this, the whole sea-coast was
exposed to danger: ruthless pirates were continually prowling along
the shores. Commerce was nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[i.11]</a></span> extinguished, and great losses had
been experienced by men in business. A recent expedition against
Canada had exposed the colonies to the vengeance of France.</p>

<p>The province was encumbered with oppressive taxes, and weighed down by
a heavy debt. The sum assessed upon Salem to defray the expenses of
the country at large, the year before the witchcraft prosecutions, was
&#163;1,346. 1<i>s.</i> Besides this, there were the town taxes. The whole
amounted, no doubt, inclusive of the support of the ministry, to a
weight of taxation, considering the greater value of money at that
time, of which we have no experience, and can hardly form an adequate
conception. The burden pressed directly upon the whole community.
There were then no great private fortunes, no moneyed institutions, no
considerable foreign commerce, few, if any, articles of luxury, and no
large business-capitals to intercept and divert its pressure. It was
borne to its whole extent by the unaided industry of a population of
extremely moderate estates and very limited earnings, and almost
crushed it to the earth.</p>

<p>The people were dissatisfied with the new charter. They were becoming
the victims of political jealousies, discontent, and animosities. They
had been agitated by great revolutions. They were surrounded by
alarming indications of change, and their ears were constantly
assailed by rumors of war. Their minds were startled and confounded by
the prevalence of prophecies and forebodings of dark and dismal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[i.12]</a></span>
events. At this most unfortunate moment, and, as it were, to crown the
whole and fill up the measure of their affliction and terror, it was
their universal and sober belief, that the Evil One himself was, in a
special manner, let loose, and permitted to descend upon them with
unexampled fury.</p>

<p>The people of Salem participated in their full share of the gloom and
despondency that pervaded the province, and, in addition to that, had
their own peculiar troubles and distresses. Within a short time, the
town had lost almost all its venerable fathers and leading citizens,
the men whose councils had governed and whose wisdom had guided them
from the first years of the settlement of the place. Only those who
are intimately acquainted with the condition of a community of simple
manners and primitive feelings, such as were the early New-England
settlements, can have an adequate conception of the degree to which
the people were attached to their patriarchs, the extent of their
dependence upon them, and the amount of the loss when they were
removed.</p>

<p>In the midst of this general distress and local gloom and depression,
the great and awful tragedy, whose incidents, scenes, and characters I
am to present, took place.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#160;I</span><b>T</b> is necessary, before entering upon the subject of the witchcraft
delusion, to give a particular and extended account of the immediate
locality where it occurred, and of the community occupying it. This is
demanded by justice to the parties concerned, and indispensable to a
correct understanding of the transaction. No one, in truth, can
rightly appreciate the character of the rural population of the towns
first settled in Massachusetts, without tracing it to its origin, and
taking into view the policy that regulated the colonization of the
country at the start.</p>

<p>&quot;The Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England&quot;
possessed, by its charter from James the First, dated Nov. 3, 1620,
and renewed by Charles the First, March 4, 1629, the entire
sovereignty over all the territory assigned to it. Some few conditions
and exceptions were incorporated in the grant, which, in the event,
proved to be merely nom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[i.16]</a></span>inal. The company, so far as the crown and
sovereignty of England were concerned, became absolute owner of the
whole territory within its limits, and exercised its powers
accordingly. It adopted wise and efficient measures to promote the
settlement of the country by emigrants of the best description. It
gave to every man who transported himself at his own charge fifty
acres of land, and lots, in distinction from farms, to those who
should choose to settle and build in towns. In 1628, Captain John
Endicott, one of the original patentees, was sent over to superintend
the management of affairs on the spot, and carry out the views of the
company. On the 30th of April, 1629, the company, by a full and free
election, chose said Endicott to be &quot;Governor of the Plantation in the
Massachusetts Bay,&quot; to hold office for one year &quot;from the time he
shall take the oath,&quot; and gave him instructions for his government. In
reference to the disposal of lands, they provided that persons &quot;who
were adventurers,&quot; that is, subscribers to the common stock, to the
amount of fifty pounds, should have two hundred acres of land, and, at
that rate, more or less, &quot;to the intent to build their houses, and to
improve their labors thereon.&quot; Adventurers who carried families with
them were to have fifty acres for each member of their respective
families. Other provisions were made, on the same principles, to meet
the case of servants taken over; for each of whom an additional number
of acres was to be allowed. If a person should choose &quot;to build on
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[i.17]</a></span> plot of ground where the town is intended to be built,&quot; he was to
have half an acre for every fifty pounds subscribed by him to the
common stock. A general discretion was given to Endicott and his
council to make grants to particular persons, &quot;according to their
charge and quality;&quot; having reference always to the ability of the
grantee to improve his allotment. Energetic and intelligent men,
having able-bodied sons or servants, even if not adventurers, were to
be favorably regarded. Endicott carried out these instructions
faithfully and judiciously during his brief administration. In the
mean time, it had been determined to transfer the charter, and the
company bodily, to New England. Upon this being settled, John
Winthrop, with others, joined the company, and he was elected its
governor on the 29th of October, 1629. On the 12th of June, 1630, he
arrived in Salem, and held his first court at Charlestown on the 28th
of August.</p>

<p>There was some irregularity in these proceedings. The charter fixed a
certain time, &quot;yearly, once in the year, for ever hereafter,&quot; for the
election of governor, deputy-governor, and assistants. Matthew Cradock
had been elected accordingly, on the 13th of May, 1629, governor of
the company &quot;for the year following.&quot; He presided at the General Court
of the company when Winthrop was elected governor. There does not
appear to have been any formal resignation of his office by Cradock.
In point of fact, the charter made no provision for a resignation of
office, but only for cases where a vacancy might be occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[i.18]</a></span> by
death, or removal by an act of the company. It would have been more
regular for the company to have removed Cradock by a formal vote; but
the great and weighty matter in which they were engaged prevented
their thinking of a mere formality. Cradock had himself conceived the
project they had met to carry into effect, and labored to bring it
about. He vacated the chair to his successor, on the spot. Still
forgetting the provisions of the charter, they declared Winthrop
elected &quot;for the ensuing year, to begin on this present day,&quot; the 20th
of October, 1629. By the language of the charter, he could only be
elected to fill the vacancy &quot;in the room or place&quot; of Cradock; that
is, for the residue of the official year established by the express
provision of that instrument, namely, until the &quot;last Wednesday in
Easter term&quot; ensuing. All usage is in favor of this construction. The
terms of the charter are explicit; and, if persons chosen to fill
vacancies during the course of a year could thus be commissioned to
hold an entire year from the date of their election, the provision
fixing a certain day &quot;yearly&quot; for the choice of officers would be
utterly nullified. Whether this subsequently occurred to Winthrop and
his associates is not known; but, if it did, it was impossible for
them to act in conformity to the view now given; for, in the ensuing
&quot;last Wednesday of Easter term,&quot; he was at sea, in mid ocean, and the
several members of the company dispersed throughout his fleet. When he
arrived in Salem, he found Endicott&#8212;who, in the records of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[i.19]</a></span>
company before its transfer to New England, is styled &quot;the Governor
beyond the seas&quot;&#8212;with his year of office not yet expired. The company
had not chosen another in his place, and his commission still held
good. It was so evident that the vote extending the term of Winthrop's
tenure to a year from the day on which he was chosen, Oct. 20, 1629,
was illegal, that when that year expired, in October, 1630, no motion
was made to proceed to a new election. In the mean time, however,
Endicott's year had expired; and, for aught that appears, there was
not, for several months, any legal governor or government at all in
the colony. When the next &quot;last Wednesday of Easter term&quot; came round,
on the 18th of May, 1631, Winthrop was chosen governor, as the record
says, &quot;according to the meaning of the patent;&quot; and all went on
smoothly afterwards. If the difficulty into which they had got was
apprehended by Winthrop, Endicott, or any of their associates, they
were wise enough to see that nothing but mischief could arise from
taking notice of it; that no human ingenuity could disentangle the
snarl; and that all they could do was to wait for the lapse of time to
drift them through. The conduct of these two men on the occasion was
truly admirable. Endicott welcomed Winthrop with all the honors due to
his position as governor; opened his doors to receive him and his
family; and manifested the affectionate respect and veneration with
which, from his earliest manhood to his dying day, Winthrop ever
inspired all men in all circumstances. Winthrop per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[i.20]</a></span>formed the
ceremony at Endicott's marriage. They each went about his own
business, and said nothing of the embarrassments attached to their
official titles or powers. After a few months, Winthrop held his
courts, as though all was in good shape; and Endicott took his seat as
an assistant. They proved themselves sensible, high-minded men, of
true public spirit, and friends to each other and to the country,
which will for ever honor them both as founders and fathers. They
entered into no disputes&#8212;and their descendants never should&#8212;about
which was governor, or which first governor.</p>

<p>The disposal of lands, at the expiration of Endicott's delegated
administration, passed back into the hands of the company, and was
conducted by the General Court upon the policy established at its
meetings in London. On the 3d of March, 1635, the General Court
relinquished the control and disposal of lands, within the limits of
towns, to the towns themselves. After this, all grants of lands in
Salem were made by the people of the town or their own local courts.
The original land policy was faithfully adhered to here, as it
probably was in the other towns.</p>

<p>The following is a copy of the Act:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Whereas particular towns have many things which concern
only themselves, and the ordering of their own affairs, and
disposing of businesses in their own towns, it is therefore
ordered, that the freemen of any town, or the major part of
them, shall only have power to dispose of their own lands
and woods, with all the privileges and appurtenances of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[i.21]</a></span>
said towns, to grant lots, and make such orders as may
concern the well ordering of their own towns, not repugnant
to the laws and orders here established by the General
Court; as also to lay mulcts and penalties for the breach of
these orders, and to levy and distress the same, not
exceeding the sum of twenty shillings; also to choose their
own particular officers, as constables, surveyors of the
high-ways, and the like; and because much business is like
to ensue to the constables of several towns, by reason they
are to make distress, and gather fines, therefore that every
town shall have two constables, where there is need, that so
their office may not be a burthen unto them, and they may
attend more carefully upon the discharge of their office,
for which they shall be liable to give their accounts to
this court, when they shall be called thereunto.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The reflecting student of political science will probably regard this
as the most important legislative act in our annals. Towns had existed
before, but were scarcely more than local designations, or convenient
divisions of the people and territories. This called them into being
as depositories and agents of political power in its mightiest
efficacy and most vital force. It remitted to the people their
original sovereignty. Before, that sovereignty had rested in the hands
of a remote central deputation; this returned it to them in their
primary capacity, and brought it back, in its most important elements,
to their immediate control. It gave them complete possession and
absolute power over their own lands, and provided the machinery for
managing their own neighborhoods and making and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[i.22]</a></span> executing their own
laws in what is, after all, the greatest sphere of government,&#8212;that
which concerns ordinary, daily, immediate relations. It gave to the
people the power to do and determine all that the people can do and
determine, by themselves. It created the towns as the solid foundation
of the whole political structure of the State, trained the people as
in a perpetual school for self-government, and fitted them to be the
guardians of republican liberty and order.</p>

<p>Large tracts were granted to men who had the disposition and the means
for improving them by opening roads, building bridges, clearing
forests, and bringing the surface into a state for cultivation. Men of
property, education, and high social position, were thus made to lead
the way in developing the agricultural resources of the country, and
giving character to the farming interest and class. In cases where men
of energy, industry, and intelligence presented themselves, if not
adventurers in the common stock, with no other property than their
strong arms and resolute wills, particularly if they had able-bodied
sons, liberal grants were made. Every one who had received a town lot
of half an acre was allowed to relinquish it, receiving, in exchange,
a country lot of fifty acres or more. Under this system, a population
of a superior order was led out into the forest. Farms quickly spread
into the interior, seeking the meadows, occupying the arable land, and
especially following up the streams.</p>

<p>I propose to illustrate this by a very particular enumeration of
instances, and by details that will give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[i.23]</a></span> us an insight of the
personal, domestic, and social elements that constituted the condition
of life in the earliest age of New England, particularly in that part
of the old township of Salem where the scene of our story is laid. I
shall give an account of the persons and families who first settled
the region included in, and immediately contiguous to, Salem Village,
and whose children and grandchildren were actors or sufferers in, or
witnesses of, the witchcraft delusion. I am able, by the <a href="#map">map</a>, to show
the boundaries, to some degree of precision, of their farms, and the
spots on or near which their houses stood.</p>

<p>The first grant of land made by the company, after it had got fairly
under way, was of six hundred acres to Governor Winthrop, on the 6th
of September, 1631, &quot;near his house at Mystic.&quot; The next was to the
deputy-governor, Thomas Dudley, on the 5th of June, 1632, of two
hundred acres &quot;on the west side of Charles River, over against the new
town,&quot; now Cambridge. The next, on the 3d of July, 1632, was three
hundred acres to John Endicott. It is described, in the record, as
&quot;bounded on the south side with a river, commonly called the Cow House
River, on the north side with a river, commonly called the Duck River,
on the east with a river, leading up to the two former rivers, known
by the name of Wooleston River, and on the west with the main land.&quot;
The meaning of the Indian word applied to this territory was
&quot;Birch-wood.&quot; At the period of the witchcraft delusion, and for some
time afterwards, &quot;Cow House River&quot; was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[i.24]</a></span> called &quot;Endicott River.&quot;
Subsequently it acquired the name of &quot;Waters River.&quot;</p>

<p>This grant constituted what was called &quot;the Governor's Orchard Farm.&quot;
In conformity with the policy on which grants were made, Endicott at
once proceeded to occupy and improve it, by clearing off the woods,
erecting buildings, making roads, and building bridges. His
dwelling-house embraced in its view the whole surrounding country,
with the arms of the sea. From the more elevated points of his farm,
the open sea was in sight. A road was opened by him, from the head of
tide water on Duck, now Crane, River, through the Orchard Farm, and
round the head of Cow House River, to the town of Salem, in one
direction, and to Lynn and Boston in another. A few years afterwards,
the town granted him two hundred acres more, contiguous to the western
line of the Orchard Farm. After this, and as a part of the
transaction, the present Ipswich road was made, and the old road
through the Orchard Farm discontinued. This illustrates the policy of
the land grants. They were made to persons who had the ability to lay
out roads. The present bridge over Crane River was probably built by
Endicott and the parties to whom what is now called the Plains, one of
the principal villages of Danvers, had been granted. The tract granted
by the town was popularly called the &quot;Governor's Plain.&quot; By giving, in
this way, large tracts of land to men of means, the country was opened
and made accessible to settlers who had no pecuniary ability to incur
large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[i.25]</a></span> outlays in the way of general improvements, but had the
requisite energy and industry to commence the work of subduing the
forest and making farms for themselves. To them, smaller grants were
made.</p>

<p>The character of the population, thus aided at the beginning in
settling the country, cannot be appreciated without giving some idea
of what it was to open the wilderness for occupancy and cultivation.
This is a subject which those who have always lived in other than
frontier towns do not perhaps understand.</p>

<p>How much of the land had been previously cleared by the aboriginal
tribes, it may be somewhat difficult to determine. They were but
slightly attached to the soil, had temporary and movable habitations,
and no bulky implements or articles of furniture. They were nomadic in
their habits. On the coast and its inlets, their light canoes gave
easy means of transportation, for their families and all that they
possessed, from point to point, and, further inland, over intervening
territory, from river to river. They probably seldom attempted, in
this part of the country, to clear the rugged and stony uplands. In
some instances, they removed the trees from the soft alluvial meadows,
although it is probable that in only a very few localities they would
have attempted such a persistent and laborious undertaking. There were
large salt marshes, and here and there meadows, free from timber.
There were spots where fires had swept over the land and the trees
disappeared. On such spots they probably planted their corn; the land
being made at once fertile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[i.26]</a></span> and easily cultivable, by the effects of
the fires. Near large inland sheets of water, having no outlets
passable by their canoes, and well stocked with fish, they sometimes
had permanent plantations, as at Will's Hill. With such slight
exceptions, when the white settler came upon his grant, he found it
covered by the primeval wilderness, thickly set with old trees, whose
roots, as well as branches, were interlocked firmly with each other,
the surface obstructed with tangled and prickly underbrush; the soil
broken, and mixed with rocks and stones,&#8212;the entire face of the
country hilly, rugged, and intersected by swamps and winding streams.</p>

<p>Among all the achievements of human labor and perseverance recorded in
history, there is none more herculean than the opening of a
New-England forest to cultivation. The fables of antiquity are all
suggestive of instruction, and infold wisdom. The earliest inhabitants
of every wooded country, who subdued its wilderness, were truly a race
of giants.</p>

<p>Let any one try the experiment of felling and eradicating a single
tree, and he will begin to approach an estimate of what the first
English settler had before him, as he entered upon his work. It was
not only a work of the utmost difficulty, calling for the greatest
possible exercise of physical toil, strength, patience, and
perseverance, but it was a work of years and generations. The axe,
swung by muscular arms, could, one by one, fell the trees. There was
no machinery to aid in extracting the tough roots, equal, often, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[i.27]</a></span>
size and spread, to the branches. The practice was to level by the axe
a portion of the forest, managing so as to have the trees fall inward,
early in the season. After the summer had passed, and the fallen
timber become dried, fire would be set to the whole tract covered by
it. After it had smouldered out, there would be left charred trunks
and stumps. The trunks would then be drawn together, piled in heaps,
and burned again. Between the blackened stumps, barley or some other
grain, and probably corn, would be planted, and the lapse of years
waited for, before the roots would be sufficiently decayed to enable
oxen with chains to extract them. Then the rocks and stones would have
to be removed, before the plough could, to any considerable extent, be
applied. As late as 1637, the people of Salem voted twenty acres, to
be added within two years to his previous grant, to Richard
Hutchinson, upon the condition that he would, in the mean time, &quot;set
up ploughing.&quot; The meadow to the eastward of the meeting-house, seen
in the head-piece of this Part, probably was the ground where
ploughing was thus first &quot;set up.&quot; The plough had undoubtedly been
used before in town-lots, and by some of the old planters who had
secured favorable open locations along the coves and shores; but it
required all this length of time to bring the interior country into a
condition for its use.</p>

<p>The opening of a wilderness combined circumstances of interest which
are not, perhaps, equalled in any other occupation. It is impossible
to imagine a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[i.28]</a></span> more exhilarating or invigorating employment. It
developed the muscular powers more equally and effectively than any
other. The handling of the axe brought into exercise every part of the
manly frame. It afforded room for experience and skill, as well as
strength; it was an athletic art of the highest kind, and awakened
energy, enterprise, and ambition; it was accompanied with sufficient
danger to invest it with interest, and demand the most careful
judgment and observation. He who best knew how to fell a tree was
justly looked upon as the most valuable and the leading man. To bring
a tall giant of the woods to the ground was a noble and perilous
achievement. As it slowly trembled and tottered to its fall, it was
all-important to give it the right direction, so that, as it came down
with a thundering crash, it might not be diverted from its expected
course by the surrounding trees and their multifarious branches, or
its trunk slide off or rebound in an unforeseen manner, scattering
fragments and throwing limbs upon the choppers below. Accidents often,
deaths sometimes, occurred. A skilful woodman, by a glance at the
surrounding trees and their branches, could tell where the tree on
which he was about to operate should fall, and bring it unerringly to
the ground in the right direction. There was, moreover, danger from
lurking savages; and, if the chopper was alone in the deep woods, from
the prowling solitary bear, or hungry wolves, which, going in packs,
were sometimes formidable. There were elements also, in the work, that
awakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[i.29]</a></span> the finer sentiments. The lonely and solemn woods are God's
first temples. They are full of mystic influences; they nourish the
poetic nature; they feed the imagination. The air is elastic, and
every sound reverberates in broken, strange, and inexplicable
intonations. The woods are impregnated with a health-giving and
delightful fragrance nowhere else experienced. All the arts of modern
luxury fail to produce an aroma like that which pervades a primitive
forest of pines and spruces. Indeed, all trees, in an original
wilderness, where they exist in every stage of growth and decay,
contribute to this peculiar charm of the woods. It was not only a
manly, but a most lively, occupation. When many were working near each
other, the echoes of their voices of cheer, of the sharp and ringing
tones of their axes, and of the heavy concussions of the falling
timber, produced a music that filled the old forests with life, and
made labor joyous and refreshing.</p>

<p>The length of time required to prepare a country covered by a
wilderness, on a New-England soil, for cultivation, may be estimated
by the facts I have stated. A long lapse of years must intervene,
after the woods have been felled and their dried trunks and branches
burned, before the stumps can be extracted, the land levelled, the
stones removed, the plough introduced, or the smooth green fields,
which give such beauty to agricultural scenes, be presented. An
immense amount of the most exhausting labor must be expended in the
process. The world looks with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[i.30]</a></span> wonder on the dykes of Holland, the
wall of China, the pyramids of Egypt. I do not hesitate to say that
the results produced by the small, scattered population of the
American colonies, during their first century, in tearing up a
wilderness by its roots, transforming the rocks, with which the
surface was covered, into walls, opening roads, building bridges, and
making a rough and broken country smooth and level, converting a
sterile waste into fertile fields blossoming with verdure and grains
and fruitage, is a more wonderful monument of human industry and
perseverance than them all. It was a work, not of mere hired laborers,
still less of servile minions, but of freemen owning, or winning by
their voluntary and cheerful toil, the acres on which they labored,
and thus entitling themselves to be the sovereigns of the country they
were creating. A few thousands of such men, with such incentives,
wrought wonders greater than millions of slaves or serfs ever have
accomplished, or ever will.</p>

<p>It was not, therefore, from mere favoritism, or a blind subserviency
to men of wealth or station, that such liberal grants of land were
made to Winthrop, Dudley, Endicott, and others, but for various wise
and good reasons, having the welfare and happiness of the whole
people, especially the poorer classes, in view. In illustration of the
one now under consideration, a few facts may be presented. They will
show the amount of labor required to bring the &quot;Orchard Farm&quot; into
cultivation, and which must have been procured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[i.31]</a></span> at a large outlay in
money by the proprietor. In the court-files are many curious papers,
in the shape of depositions given by witnesses in suits of various
kinds, arising from time to time, showing that large numbers of hired
men were kept constantly at work. Nov. 10, 1678, Edmund Grover,
seventy-eight years old, testified, &quot;that, above forty-five years
since, I, this deponent, wrought much upon Governor Endicott's farm,
called Orchard, and did, about that time, help to cut and cleave about
seven thousand palisadoes, as I remember, and was the first that made
improvement thereof, by breaking up of ground and planting of
Indian-corn.&quot; The land was granted to Endicott in July, 1632; and the
work in which Grover, with others, was engaged, commenced undoubtedly
forthwith. Palisadoes were young trees, of about six inches in
diameter at the butt, cut into poles of about ten feet in length,
sharpened at the larger end, and driven into the ground; those that
were split or cloven were used as rails. In this way, lots were fenced
in. In some cases, the upright posts were placed close together, as
palisades in fortifications, to prevent the escape of domestic
animals, and as a safeguard against depredations upon the young
cattle, sheep, and poultry, by bears, wolves, foxes, the loup-cervier,
or wild-cat, with which the woods were infested. Grover seems to have
wrought on the Orchard Farm for a short time. We find, that, a few
years after the point to which his testimony goes back, he had a farm
of his own. Some wrought there for a longer time, and were permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[i.32]</a></span>
retainers on the farm. In 1635, the widow Scarlett apprenticed her son
Benjamin, then eleven years of age, to Governor Endicott. The
following document, recorded in Essex Registry of Deeds, tells his
story:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;To all christian people to whom these presents shall come,
I, Benjamin Scarlett of Salem, in New England, sendeth
Greeting&#8212;Know ye, that I, the said Benjamin Scarlett,
having lived as a servant with Mr. John Endicott, Esq.,
sometimes Governor in New England, and served him near upon
thirty years, for, and in consideration whereof, the said
Governor Endicott gave unto me, the said Benjamin Scarlett,
a certain tract of land, in the year 1650, being about 10
acres, more or less, the which land hath ever since been
possessed by me, the said Benjamin Scarlett, and it lyeth at
the head of Cow House River, bounded on the north with the
land of Mr. Endicott called Orchard Farm, on the South with
the high way leading to the salt water, on the West with the
road way leading to Salem, on the East with the salt water,
which tract of land was given to me, as aforesaid, during my
life, and in case I should leave no issue of my body, to
give it to such of his posterity as I should see cause to
bestow it upon; Know ye, therefore, that I, the said
Benjamin Scarlett, for divers considerations me thereunto
moving, have given, granted, and by these presents do give
and grant, assign, sett over, and bestow the aforesaid tract
of land, with all the improvements I have made thereon, both
by building, fencing, or otherwise, unto Samuel Endicott,
second son to Zerubabel Endicott deceased, and unto Hannah
his wife, to have and to hold the said ten acres of land,
more or less, with all the privileges and appurtenances
thereunto belonging, unto the said Samuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[i.33]</a></span> Endicott and
Hannah his wife, to his and her own proper use and behoof
forever; and after their decease I give the said tract of
land to their son Samuel Endicott. In case he should depart
this life without issue, then to be given to the next heir
of the said Samuel and Hannah.&#8212;In witness whereof I have
hereunto set my hand and seal.&#8212;Dated the ninth of January
one thousand six hundred and ninety one.&#8212;<span class="smcap">Benjamin
Scarlett</span>, his mark.&quot;</p></div>

<p>It is to be observed, that Governor Endicott had died twenty-six
years, and his son Zerubabel seven years, before the date of the
foregoing deed. No writings had passed between them in reference to
the final disposition Scarlett was conditionally to make of the
estate. There were no living witnesses of the original understanding.
But the old man was true to the sentiments of honor and gratitude. The
master to whom he had been apprenticed in his boyhood had been kind
and generous to him, and he was faithful to the letter and spirit of
his engagement. He evidently made a point to have the language of the
deed as strong as it could be. He did not leave the matter to be
settled by a will, but determined to enjoy, while living, the
satisfaction of being true to his plighted faith. He was known, in his
later years, as &quot;old Ben Scarlett.&quot; He did not feel ashamed to call
himself a servant. But humble and unpretending as he was, I feel a
pride in rescuing his name from oblivion. Old Ben Scarlett will for
ever hold his place among nature's nobles,&#8212;honest men.</p>

<p>The extent to which Endicott went in improving his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[i.34]</a></span> lands is shown in
the particular department which gave the name to his original grant.
In 1648, he bought of Captain Trask two hundred and fifty acres of
land, in another locality, giving in exchange five hundred
apple-trees, of three years' growth. Such a number of fruit-trees of
that age, disposable at so early a period, could only be the result of
a great expenditure of labor and money. So many operations going on
under his direction and within his premises made his farm a school, in
which large numbers were trained to every variety of knowledge needed
by an original settler. The subduing of the wilderness; the breaking
of the ground; the building of bridges, stone-walls, &quot;palisadoes,&quot;
houses, and barns; the processes of planting; the introduction of all
suitable articles of culture; the methods best adapted to the
preparation of the rugged soil for production; the rearing of abundant
orchards and bountiful crops; the smoothing and levelling of lands,
and the laying-out of roads,&#8212;these were all going at once, and it was
quite desirable for young men to work on his farm, before going out
deeper into the wilderness to make farms for themselves. There were
many besides Grover who availed themselves of the advantage. John
Putnam was a large landholder, and an original grantee; but we find
his youngest son, John, attached to Endicott's establishment, and
working on his farm about the time of his maturity. In a deposition in
court, in a land case of disputed boundaries, August, 1705, &quot;John
Putnam, Sr., of full age, testifieth and saith that&#8212;being a re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[i.35]</a></span>tainer
in Governor Endicott's family, about fifty years since, and being
intimately acquainted with the governor himself and with his son, Mr.
Zerubabel Endicott, late of Salem, deceased, who succeeded in his
father's right, and lived and died on the farm called Orchard Farm, in
Salem&#8212;the said Governor Endicott did oftentimes tell this deponent,&quot;
&amp;c. The same John Putnam, in a deposition dated 1678, says that he was
then fifty years old, and that, thirty-five years before, he was at
Mr. Endicott's farm, and went out to a certain place called &quot;Vine
Cove,&quot; where he found Mr. Endicott; and he testifies to a conversation
that he heard between Mr. Endicott and one of his men, Walter Knight.
I mention these things to show that a lad of fifteen, a son of a
neighbor of large estate in lands, was an intimate visitor at the
Orchard Farm; and that, when he became of age, before entering upon
the work of clearing lands of his own, given by his father, he went as
&quot;a retainer&quot; to work on the governor's farm. He went as a voluntary
laborer, as to a school of agricultural training. This was done on
other farms, first occupied by men who had the means and the
enterprise to carry on large operations. It gave a high character, in
their particular employment, to the first settlers generally.</p>

<p>I cannot leave this subject of Endicott on his farm, without
presenting another picture, drawn from a wilderness scene. In 1678,
Nathaniel Ingersol, then forty-five years of age, in a deposition
sworn to in court, describes an incident that occurred on the east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[i.36]</a></span>ern
end of the Townsend Bishop farm as laid out on the <a href="#map">map</a>, when he was
about eleven years of age. His father, Richard Ingersol, had leased
the farm. It was contiguous to Endicott's land, and controversies of
boundary arose, which subsequently contributed to aggravate the feuds
and passions that were let loose in the fury of the witchcraft
proceedings. Nathaniel Ingersol says,&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;This deponent testifieth, that, when my father had fenced
in a parcel of land where the wolf-pits now are, the said
Governor Endicott came to my father where we were at plough,
and said to my father he had fenced in some of the said
Governor's land. My father replied, then he would remove the
fence. No, said Governor Endicott, let it stand; and, when
you set up a new fence, we will settle in the bounds.&quot;</p></div>

<p>This statement is worthy of being preserved, as it illustrates the
character of the two men, exhibiting them in a most honorable light.
The gentlemanly bearing of each is quite observable. Ingersol
manifests an instant willingness to repair a wrong, and set the matter
right; Endicott is considerate and obliging on a point where men are
most prone to be obstinate and unyielding,&#8212;a conflict of land rights:
both are courteous, and disposed to accommodate. Endicott was governor
of the colony, and a large conterminous landowner; Ingersol was a
husbandman, at work with his boys on land into which their labor had
incorporated value, and with which, for the time being, he was
identified. But Endicott showed no arrogance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[i.37]</a></span> and assumed no
authority; Ingersol manifested no resentment or irritation. If a
similar spirit had been everywhere exhibited, the good-will and
harmony of neighborhoods would never have been disturbed, and the
records of courts reduced to less than half their bulk.</p>

<p>To his dying day, John Endicott retained a lively interest in
promoting the welfare of his neighbors in the vicinity of the Orchard
Farm.</p>

<p>Father Gabriel Druillettes was sent by the Governor of Canada, in
1650, to Boston, in a diplomatic character, to treat with the
Government here. He kept a journal, during his visit, from which the
following is an extract: &quot;I went to Salem to speak to the Sieur
Indicatt who speaks and understands French well, and is a good friend
of the nation, and very desirous to have his children entertain this
sentiment. Finding I had no money, he supplied me, and gave me an
invitation to the magistrates' table.&quot; Endicott had undoubtedly
received a good education. His natural force of character had been
brought under the influence of the knowledge prevalent in his day, and
invigorated by an experience and aptitude in practical affairs. There
is some evidence that he had, in early life, been a surgeon or
physician.</p>

<p>He was a captain in the military service before leaving England.
Although he was the earliest who bore the title of governor here,
having been deputed to exercise that office by the governor and
company in England, and subsequently elected to that station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[i.38]</a></span> for a
greater length of time than any other person in our history, had been
colonel of the Essex militia, commandant of the expedition against the
Indians at Block Island, and, for several years, major-general, at the
head of the military forces of the colony, the title of captain was
attached to him, more or less, from beginning to end; and it is a
singular circumstance, that it has adhered to the name to this day.
His descendants early manifested a predilection for maritime life.
During the first half of the present century, many of them were
shipmasters. In our foreign, particularly our East-India, navigation,
the title has clung to the name; so much so, that the story is told,
that, half a century ago, when American ships arrived at Sumatra or
Java, the natives, on approaching or entering the vessels to ascertain
the name of the captain, were accustomed to inquire, &quot;Who is the
Endicott?&quot; The public station, rank, and influence of Governor
Endicott required that he should first be mentioned, in describing the
elements that went to form the character of the original agricultural
population of this region.</p>

<p>The <a href="#map">map</a> shows the farm of Emanuel Downing. The lines are substantially
correct, although precise accuracy cannot be claimed for them, as the
points mentioned in this and other cases were marked trees, heaps of
stones, or other perishable or removable objects, and no survey or
plot has come down to us. A collation of conterminous grants or
subsequent conveyances, with references in some of them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[i.39]</a></span> permanent
objects, enables us to approximate to a pretty certain conclusion.
This gentleman was one of the most distinguished of the early
New-England colonists. He was a lawyer of the Inner Temple. He
married, in the first instance, a daughter of Sir James Ware, a person
of great eminence in the learned lore of his times. His second wife
was Lucy, sister of Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts, who was born
July 9, 1601. They were married, April 10, 1622. There seems to have
been a very strong attachment between Emanuel Downing and his brother
Winthrop; and they went together, with their whole heart, into the
plan of building up the colony. They devoted to it their fortunes and
lives. Downing is supposed to have arrived at Boston in August, 1638,
with his family. On the 4th of November, he and his wife were admitted
to the Church at Salem. So great had been the value of his services in
behalf of the colony, in defending its interests and watching over its
welfare before leaving England, that he was welcomed with the utmost
cordiality to his new home. His nephew, John Winthrop, Jr., afterwards
Governor of Connecticut, was associated with John Endicott to
administer to him the freeman's oath. The General Court granted him
six hundred acres of land. He was immediately appointed a judge of the
local court in Salem, and, for many years, elected one of its two
deputies to the General Court. In anticipation of his arrival in the
country, the town of Salem, on the 16th of July, granted him five
hundred acres. He after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[i.40]</a></span>wards purchased the farm on which he seems to
have lived, for the most part, until he went to England in 1652. The
condition of public affairs, and his own connection with them,
detained him in the mother-country much of the latter part of his
life. While in this colony, he was indefatigable in his exertions to
secure its prosperity. His wealth and time and faculties were
liberally and constantly devoted to this end.</p>

<p>The active part taken by Mr. Downing in the affairs of the settlement
is illustrated in the following extract from the Salem town records:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;At a general Town meeting, held the 7<sup>th</sup> day of the 5<sup>th</sup>
month, 1644&#8212;ordered that two be appointed every Lord's Day,
to walk forth in the time of God's worship, to take notice
of such as either lye about the meeting house, without
attending to the word and ordinances, or that lye at home or
in the fields without giving good account thereof, and to
take the names of such persons, and to present them to the
magistrates, whereby they may be accordingly proceeded
against. The names of such as are ordered to this service
are for the 1<sup>st</sup> day, M<sup>r.</sup> Stileman and Philip Veren J<sup>r.</sup>
2<sup>d</sup> day, Philip Veren S<sup>r.</sup> and Hilliard Veren. 3<sup>d</sup> day, M<sup>r.</sup>
Batter and Joshua Veren. 4<sup>th</sup> day, M<sup>r.</sup> Johnson and M<sup>r.</sup>
Clark. 5<sup>th</sup> day, M<sup>r.</sup> Downing and Robert Molton S<sup>r.</sup> 6<sup>th</sup>
day, Robert Molton J<sup>r.</sup> and Richard Ingersol. 7<sup>th</sup> day, John
Ingersol and Richard Pettingell. 8<sup>th</sup> day, William Haynes
and Richard Hutchinson. 9<sup>th</sup> day, John Putnam and John
Hathorne. 10<sup>th</sup> day, Townsend Bishop and Daniel Rea. 11<sup>th</sup>
day, John Porter and Jacob Barney.&quot;</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[i.41]</a></span></p>

<p>Each patrol, on concluding its day's service, was to notify the
succeeding one; and they were to start on their rounds, severally,
from &quot;Goodman Porter's near the Meeting House.&quot;</p>

<p>The men appointed to this service were all leading characters,
reliable and energetic persons. It was a singular arrangement, and
gives a vivid idea of the state of things at the time. Its design was
probably, not merely that expressed in the vote of the town, but also
to prevent any disorderly conduct on the part of those not attending
public worship, and to give prompt alarm in case of fire or an Indian
assault. The population had not then spread out far into the country;
and the range of exploration did not much extend beyond the settlement
in the town. None but active men, however, could have performed the
duty thoroughly, and in all directions, so as to have kept the whole
community under strict inspection.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing probably expended liberally his fortune and time in
improving his farm, upon which there were, at least, four
dwelling-houses prior to 1661, and large numbers of men employed. He
was a ready contributor to all public objects. His education had been
superior and his attainments in knowledge extensive. He was of an
enlightened spirit, and strove to mitigate the severity of the
procedures against Antinomians and others. He seems to have had an
ingenious and enterprising mind. At a General Court held at Boston,
Sept. 6, 1638, it was voted that, &quot;Whereas Emanuel Downing, Esq., hath
brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[i.42]</a></span> over, at his great charges, all things fitting for taking
wild fowl by way of duck-coy, this court, being desirous to encourage
him and others in such designs as tend to the public good,&quot; &amp;c.,
orders that liberty shall be given him to set up his duck-coy within
the limits of Salem; and all persons are forbidden to molest him in
his experiments, by &quot;shooting in any gun within half a mile of the
ponds,&quot; where, by the regulations of the town, he shall be allowed to
place the decoys. The court afterwards granted to other towns liberty
to set up duck-coys, with similar privileges. What was the particular
structure of the contrivance, and how far it succeeded in operation,
is not known; but the thing shows the spirit of the man. He at once
took hold of his farm with energy, and gathered workmen upon it.
Winthrop in his journal has this entry, Aug. 2, 1645:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;M<sup>r.</sup> Downing having built a new house at his farm, he being
gone to England, and his wife and family gone to the church
meeting on the Lord's day, the chimney took fire and burned
down the house, and bedding, apparel and household, to the
value of 200 pounds.&quot;</p></div>

<p>This proves that his family resided on the farm; and it indicates,
that, when he first occupied it, he had only such a house as could
have been seasonably put up at the start, but that a more commodious
one had been erected at his leisure: the expression &quot;having built a
new house&quot; appears to carry this idea. On his return from England, he
undoubtedly built again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[i.43]</a></span> had other houses for his workmen and
tenants; for we find that one of them, in 1648, was allowed to keep an
ordinary, &quot;as Mr. Downing's farm, on the road between Lynn and
Ipswich, was a convenient place&quot; for such an accommodation to
travellers. Public travel to and from those points goes over that same
road to-day. That it was so early laid out is probably owing to the
fact, that such men as Emanuel Downing were on its route, and John
Winthrop, Jr., at Ipswich. Downing called his farm &quot;Groton,&quot; in dear
remembrance of his wife's ancestral home in &quot;the old country.&quot;</p>

<p>Originally, travel was on a track more interior. The opening of roads
did not begin until after the more immediate and necessary operations
of erecting houses and bringing the land, on the most available spots
near them at the points first settled, under culture. Originally,
communication from farm to farm, through the woods, was by marking the
trees,&#8212;sometimes by burning and blackening spots on their sides, and
sometimes by cutting off a piece of the bark. The traveller found his
way step by step, following the trees thus marked, or &quot;blazed,&quot; as it
was called whichever method had been adopted. When the branches and
brush were sufficiently cleared away, horses could be used. At places
rendered difficult by large roots, partly above ground, intercepting
the passage, or by rough stones, the rider would dismount, and lead
the horse. From this, it was called a &quot;bridle-path.&quot; After the way had
become sufficiently opened for ox-carts or other vehicles to pass, it
would begin to receive the name of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[i.44]</a></span> road. On reaching a cleared and
fenced piece of land, the traveller would cross it, opening and
closing gates, or taking down and replacing bars, as the case might
be. There were arrangements among the settlers, and, before long, acts
of the General Court, regulating the matter. This was the origin of
what were called &quot;press-roads,&quot; or &quot;farm-roads,&quot; or &quot;gate-roads.&quot; When
a proprietor concluded it to be for his interest to do so, he would
fence in the road on both sides where it crossed his land, and remove
the gates or bars from each end. Ultimately, the road, if convenient
for long travel, would be fenced in for a great distance, and become a
permanent &quot;public highway.&quot; In all these stages of progress, it would
be called a &quot;highway.&quot; The fee would remain with the several
proprietors through whose lands it passed; and, if travel should
forsake it for a more eligible route, it would be discontinued, and
the road-track, enclosed in the fields to which it originally
belonged, be obliterated by the plough. Many of the &quot;highways,&quot; by
which the farmers passed over each other's lands to get to the
meeting-house or out to public roads, in 1692, have thus disappeared,
while some have hardened into permanent public roads used to this day.
When thus fully and finally established, it became a &quot;town road,&quot; and
if leading some distance into the interior, and through other towns,
was called a &quot;country road.&quot; The early name of &quot;path&quot; continued some
time in use long after it had got to be worthy of a more pretentious
title. The old &quot;Boston Path,&quot; by which the country was originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[i.45]</a></span>
penetrated, long retained that name. It ran through the southern and
western part of Salem Village by the Gardners, Popes, Goodales,
Flints, Needhams, Swinnertons, Houltons, and so on towards Ipswich and
Newbury.</p>

<p>On the 30th of September, 1648, Governor Winthrop, writing to his son
John, says &quot;they are well at Salem, and your uncle is now beginning to
distil. Mr. Endicott hath found a copper mine in his own ground. Mr.
Leader hath tried it. The furnace runs eight tons per week, and their
bar iron is as good as Spanish.&quot; Whatever may be thought by some of
the logic which infers that &quot;all is well&quot; in Salem, because they are
beginning &quot;to distil;&quot; and however little has, as yet, resulted here
from the discovery of copper-mines, or the manufacture of iron, the
foregoing extract shows the zeal and enthusiasm with which the
wealthier settlers were applying themselves to the development of the
capabilities of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing seems to have resided permanently on his farm, and to have
been identified with the agricultural portion of the community. His
house-lot in the town bounded south on Essex Street, extending from
Newbury to St. Peter's Street. He may not, perhaps, have built upon it
for some time, as it long continued to be called &quot;Downing's Field.&quot;
Two of his daughters married sons of Thomas Gardner: Mary married
Samuel; and Ann, Joseph. They came into possession of the &quot;Downing
Field.&quot; Mary was the mother of John, the progenitor of a large branch
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[i.46]</a></span> the Gardner family. Mr. Downing had another large lot in the town,
which, on the 11th of February, 1641, was sold to John Pickering,
described in the deed as follows: &quot;All that parcel of ground, lying
before the now dwelling-house of the said John Pickering, late in the
occupation of John Endicott, Esq., with all the appurtenances
thereunto belonging, abutting on the east and south on the river
commonly called the South River, and on the west on the land of
William Hathorne, and on the north on the Town Common.&quot; The deed is
signed by Lucy Downing, and by Edmund Batter, acting for her husband
in his absence. On the 10th of February, 1644, he indorsed the
transaction as follows: &quot;I do freely agree to the sale of the said
Field in Salem, made by my wife to John Pickering: witness my hand,&quot;
&amp;c. The attesting witnesses were Samuel Sharpe and William Hathorne.
This land was then called &quot;Broad Field.&quot; On his estate, thus enlarged,
Pickering, a few years afterwards, built a house, still standing. The
estate has remained, or rather so much of it as was attached to the
homestead, in that family to this day, and is now owned and occupied
by John Pickering, Esq., son of the eminent scholar and philologist of
that name, and grandson of Colonel Timothy Pickering, of Revolutionary
fame,&#8212;the trusted friend of Washington.</p>

<p>Emanuel Downing was the father of Sir George Downing, one of the first
class that graduated at Harvard College,&#8212;a man of extraordinary
talents and wonderful fortunes. After finishing his collegiate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[i.47]</a></span>
course, in 1642, he studied divinity, probably under the direction of
Hugh Peters; went to the West Indies, acting as chaplain in the
vessel; preached and received calls to settle in several places; went
on to England; entered the parliamentary service as chaplain to a
regiment; was rapidly drawn into notice, and promoted from point to
point, until he became scoutmaster-general in Cromwell's army. This
office seems to have combined the functions of inspector and
commissary-general, and head of the reconnoitering department. In
1654, he was married to Frances, sister of Viscount Morpeth,
afterwards Earl of Carlisle; thus uniting himself with &quot;the blood of
all the Howards,&quot; one of the noblest families in England. The nuptials
were celebrated with great pomp, an epithalamium in Latin, &amp;c. All
this, within eleven years after he took his degree at Harvard, is
surely an extraordinary instance of rising in the world. He was a
member of Parliament for Scotland. Cromwell sent him to France on
diplomatic business, and his correspondence in Latin from that court
was the beginning of a career of great services in that line. He was
soon commissioned ambassador to the Hague, then the great court in
Europe. Thurlow's state papers show with what marvellous vigilance,
activity, and efficiency he conducted, from that centre, the
diplomatic affairs of the commonwealth. At the restoration of the
monarchy, he made the quickest and the loftiest somersault in all
political history. It was done between two days. He saw Charles the
Second at the Hague, on his way to England to re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[i.48]</a></span>sume his crown: and
the man who, up to that moment, had been one of the most zealous
supporters of the commonwealth, came out next morning as an equally
zealous supporter of the king. He accompanied this wonderful exploit
by an act of treachery to three of his old associates,&#8212;including
Colonel Oakey, in whose regiment he had served as chaplain,&#8212;which
cost them their lives. He was forthwith knighted, and his commission
as ambassador renewed. After a while, he returned to England; went
into Parliament from Morpeth, and ever after the exchequer was in his
hands. By his knowledge, skill, and ability, he enlarged the financial
resources of the country, multiplied its manufactures, and extended
its power and wealth. He was probably the original contriver of the
policy enforced in the celebrated Navigation Act, having suggested it
in Cromwell's time. By that single short act of Parliament, England
became the great naval power of the world; her colonial possessions,
however widely dispersed, were consolidated into one vast fountain of
wealth to the imperial realm; the empire of the seas was fixed on an
immovable basis, and the proud Hollander compelled to take down the
besom from the mast-head of his high-admiral.</p>

<p>Sir George Downing did one thing in favor of the power of the people,
in the British system of government, which may mitigate the resentment
of mankind for his execrable seizure and delivery to the royal
vengeance of Oakey, Corbett, and Barkstead. He introduced into
Parliament and established the prin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[i.49]</a></span>ciple of Specific Appropriations.
The House of Commons has, ever since, not only held the keys of the
treasury, but the power of controlling expenditures. The fortune of
Sir George, on the failure of issue in the third generation, went to
the foundation of Downing College, in Cambridge, England. It amounted
to one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling. It is not
improbable, that Downing Street, in London, owes its name to the great
diplomatist.</p>

<p>This remarkable man spent his later youth and opening manhood on Salem
Farms. In his college vacations and intervals of study, he partook,
perhaps, in the labors of the plantation, mingled with the rural
population, and shared in their sports. The crack of his fowling-piece
re-echoed through the wild woods beyond Procter's Corner; he tended
his father's duck-coys at Humphries' Pond, and angled along the clear
brooks. It is an observable circumstance, as illustrating the
transmission of family traits, that the same ingenious activity and
versatility of mind, which led Emanuel Downing, while carrying on the
multifarious operations of opening a large farm in the forest,
presiding in the local court at Salem, and serving year after year in
the General Court as a deputy, to contrive complicated machinery for
taking wild fowl and getting up distilleries, re-appeared in his son,
on the broader field of the manufactures, finances, and foreign
relations of a great nation.</p>

<p>A tract of three hundred acres, next eastward of the Downing farm, was
granted to Thomas Read. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[i.50]</a></span> became a freeman in 1634, was a member of
the Salem Church in 1636, received his grant the same year, and was
acknowledged as an inhabitant, May 2, 1637. The farm is now occupied
and owned by the Hon. Richard S. Rogers. It is a beautiful and
commanding situation, and attests the taste of its original
proprietor. Mr. Read seems to have had a passion for military affairs.
In 1636, he was ensign in a regiment composed of men from Saugus,
Ipswich, Newbury, and Salem, of which John Endicott was colonel, and
John Winthrop, Jr., lieutenant-colonel. In 1647, he commanded a
company. During the civil wars in England, he was attracted back to
his native country. He commanded a regiment in 1660, and held his
place after the Restoration. He died about 1663.</p>

<p>Our antiquarians were long at a loss to understand a sentence in one
of Roger Williams's letters to John Winthrop, Jr., in which he says,
&quot;Sir, you were not long since the son of two noble fathers, Mr. John
Winthrop and Mr. Hugh Peters.&quot; How John Winthrop, Jr., could be a son
of Hugh Peters was the puzzle. Peters was not the father of either of
Winthrop's two wives; and there was nothing in any family records or
memorials to justify the notion. On the contrary, they absolutely
precluded it. By the labors and acumen of the Hon. James Savage and
Mr. Charles Deane, of Cambridge, who have no superiors in grappling
with such a difficulty, its solution seems, at last, to be reached.
&quot;After long fruitless search,&quot; Mr. Savage has expressed a conviction
that Mr. Deane has &quot;ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[i.51]</a></span>quired the probable explication.&quot; The clue was
thus obtained: Mr. Savage says, &quot;This approach to explanation is
gained from 'the Life and Death of Hugh Peters, by William Yonge, D<sup>r.</sup>
Med. London. 1663,' a very curious and more scarce tract.&quot; The facts
discovered are that Peters taught a free school at Maldon, in Essex;
and that a widow lady with children and an estate of two or three
hundred pounds a year befriended him. She was known as &quot;Mistress
Read.&quot; Peters married her. The second wife of John Winthrop, Jr., was
Elizabeth, daughter of Colonel Read, of Essex. By marrying Mrs. Read,
Peters became the step-father of the younger Winthrop's wife; and, by
the usage of that day, he would be called Winthrop's father.</p>

<p>A few additional particulars, in reference to Peters and our Salem
Read, may shed further light on the subject. While a prisoner in the
Tower of London, awaiting the trial which, in a few short days,
consigned him to his fate, Peters wrote &quot;A Dying Father's Last Legacy
to an only Child,&quot; and delivered it to his daughter just before his
execution. This is one of the most admirable productions of genius,
wisdom, and affection, anywhere to be found. In it he gives a
condensed history of his life, which enables us to settle some
questions, which have given rise to conflicting statements, and kept
some points in his biography in obscurity. In the first place, the
title proves that he had, at the time of his death, no other child. In
the course of it, he tells his daughter, that, when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[i.52]</a></span> fourteen
years of age, his mother, then a widow, removed with him to Cambridge,
and connected him with the University there. His elder brother had
been sent to Oxford for his education. After residing eight years in
Cambridge, he took his Master's degree, and then went up to London,
where he was &quot;struck with the sense of his sinful estate by a sermon
he heard under Paul's, which was about forty years since, which text
was the <i>burden of Dumah or Idumea</i>, and stuck fast. This made me to
go into Essex; and after being quieted by another sermon in that
country, and the love and labors of Mr. Thomas Hooker, I there
preached, there married with a good gentlewoman, till I went to London
to ripen my studies, not intending to preach at all.&quot; He then relates
the circumstances which subsequently led him again to engage in
preaching. He is stated to have been born in 1599: his death was in
1660. Putting together these dates and facts, it becomes evident that
he could not have been more than twenty-two years of age when he
married &quot;Mistress Read.&quot; The &quot;Last Legacy&quot; shows, not merely in the
manner in which he speaks of her,&#8212;&quot;a good gentlewoman,&quot;&#8212;but, in its
express terms, that she was not the mother of the &quot;only child&quot; to whom
it was addressed. &quot;Besides your mother,&quot; he states that he had had &quot;a
godly wife before.&quot; There is no indication that there were children by
the earlier marriage. If there were, they died young. He married, for
his second wife, Deliverance Sheffield, at Boston, in March, 1639.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[i.53]</a></span></p>

<p>His first wife, the time of whose death is unknown, had left the
children by her former husband in his hands and under his care. He
evidently cherished the memory of the &quot;good gentlewoman of Essex&quot; with
the tenderest and most sacred affection. She had not only been the
dear wife of his youth, but her property placed him above want. No
wonder that the strongest attachment existed between him and her
children. John Winthrop, Jr., and his wife, called him father, not
merely in conformity with custom, being their step-father in point of
fact, but with the fondness and devotion of actual children. It was on
account of this intimate and endeared connection, and in consideration
of the pecuniary benefit he had derived from his marriage to the
mother of the younger Winthrop's wife, that he made arrangements, in
case he should not return to America, that his Salem property should
go to her and her husband. Having married a second wife, and there
being issue of said marriage, he would not have alienated so
considerable a part of his property from the legal heir without some
good and sufficient reason. The foregoing view of the case explains
the whole. The solution of the mystery which had enveloped Roger
Williams's language is complete. Elizabeth, the daughter of the second
marriage, to whom the &quot;Last Legacy&quot; was addressed, was baptized in the
First Church at Salem, on the 8th of March, 1640. It does not appear,
that, during her subsequent life, there was any intimacy, or even
acquaintance, between her and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[i.54]</a></span> Winthrops, as there was no ground
for it, she being in no way connected with them.</p>

<p>May not Thomas Read, of Salem, have been a son of Colonel Read, of
Maldon in Essex, and a brother of the wife of the younger Winthrop?
Peters says, in the &quot;Last Legacy,&quot; &quot;Many of my acquaintances, going
for New England, had engaged me to come to them when they sent, which
accordingly I did.&quot; Thomas Read came over some time before him; so did
John Winthrop, Jr., and wife. They were the same as children to him.
They sent for him, and he came. After it was ascertained and
determined that Peters should settle in Salem, Read joined the church
here, and became a full inhabitant. Peters located his grant of land
in sight of Read's residence, on the next then unappropriated
territory, at a distance of about two and a half miles. When Read
returned to England, he left his property here in the care of the
Winthrops. Wait Winthrop, as the agent and attorney of his heirs, sold
it to Daniel Eppes. If, as I conjecture, Thomas Read was a son of
Colonel Read, of Essex, his coming here with Peters, and his
connection with the Winthrops, are accounted for. His strong
predilection for military affairs was natural in a son of a colonel of
the English army. It led him back to the mother-country, on the first
sound of the great civil war reaching these shores, and raised him to
the rank he finally attained. The conjecture that he was a brother of
the wife of the younger Winthrop is favored by the fact, that her son,
Fitz John Win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[i.55]</a></span>throp, was a captain in Read's regiment, at the time of
the restoration of the Stuarts.</p>

<p>During the short period of the residence of Hugh Peters in America,
professional duties, and the extent to which his great talents were
called upon in ecclesiastical and political affairs, in all parts of
the colony, left him but little opportunity to attend to his
two-hundred-acre grant. It was to the north of the present village of
Danvers Plains, on the eastern side and adjoining to Frost-Fish Brook.
The history of this grant confirms the supposition of his particular
connection with the family of the younger Winthrop. It seems that it
had not been formally laid out by metes and bounds while Peters was
here. Owing to this circumstance, perhaps, it escaped confiscation at
the time of his condemnation and execution. Some years afterwards,
June 4, 1674, a committee of the town laid out the grant &quot;to Mr.
Peters.&quot; The record of this transaction says, &quot;The land is in the
possession of John Corwin.&quot; Captain John Corwin had married, in May,
1665, Margaret, daughter of John Winthrop, Jr. She survived her
husband, and sold the same land, May 22, 1693, to &quot;Henry Brown, Jr.,
of Salisbury, yeoman.&quot; These facts show that this portion of Mr.
Peters's lands did go, according to the agreement when he left
America, to the family of John Winthrop, Jr.</p>

<p>Whether he had erected a house on this grant is not known. From his
characteristic energy, activity, and promptitude, it is probable that
he had begun to clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[i.56]</a></span> it. In agriculture, as in every thing else, he
gave a decisive impulse. It is stated that he had a particular design
to attempt the culture of hemp. He introduced many implements of
labor, and started new methods of improvement. He disclosed to the
producer of agricultural growths the idea of raising what the land was
most capable of yielding in abundance, in greater quantities than were
needed for local consumption, and finding for the surplus an outside
market. He is allowed to have introduced the coasting and foreign
trade on an intelligent and organized basis, and to have promoted
ship-building and the export of the products of the forests and the
fields generally to the Southern plantations, the West Indies, and
even more distant points. If he had remained longer in the country,
the farming interests, and the settlers in what was afterwards called
Salem Village, within which his tract was situated, would have felt
his great influence. As it was, he undoubtedly did much to inspire a
zeal for improvement. His town residence was on the south-western
corner of Essex and Washington Street, then known as &quot;Salem Corner,&quot;
where the office of the Horse-railroad Company now is. The lot was a
quarter of an acre. Roger Williams probably had resided there, and
sold to Peters, who was his successor in the ministry of the First
Church, and whose attorney sold it to Benjamin Felton, in 1659. The
range of ground included within what are now Washington, Essex,
Summer, and Chestnut Streets, and extending to the South River, as it
was before any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[i.57]</a></span> dam or mills had been erected over or across it, was a
beautiful swell of land, with sloping surfaces, intersected by a creek
from near the foot of Chestnut Street to its junction with the South
River under the present grade of Mill Street. To the south of the
corner, occupied successively by Roger Williams and Hugh Peters, Ralph
Fogg, the Lady Deborah Moody, George Corwin, Dr. George Emory, Thomas
Ruck, Samuel Skelton, Endicott, Pickering, Downing, and Hathorne, each
had lots, extending in order to the foot of what is now Phelps Street.
Most, if not all of them, had houses on their lots. Elder Sharp had
what was called &quot;Sharp's Field,&quot; bordering on the north side of Essex
Street, extending from Washington to North Streets. His house was at
the north corner of Lynde and Washington Streets. Edmund Batter, Henry
Cook, Dr. Daniel Weld, Stephen Sewall, and Edward Norris, were
afterwards on his land. Hugh Peters also owned the lot, consisting of
a quarter of an acre, on the north-eastern corner of Essex and
Washington Streets, now occupied by what is known as Stearns's
Building, and was preparing to erect a house upon it when he was sent
to England. His attorney sold it, in 1652, to John Orne, the founder
of the family of that name.</p>

<p>The daughter of Mr. Peters came over to America shortly after his
death, bringing with her her mother, who, for many years, had been
subject to derangement. They were kindly received; and some of his
property, particularly a valuable farm in the vicinity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[i.58]</a></span> of Marblehead,
which the daughter sold to the American ancestor of the Devereux
family, was recovered from the effect of his attainder. She probably
soon went back to England, where she spent her days. Papers on file in
the county court show that Elizabeth Barker, widow, &quot;daughter of Mr.
Hugh Peters,&quot; was living, in March, 1702, in good health, at Deptford,
Kent, in the immediate vicinity of London, and had been living there
for about forty years.</p>

<p>In consequence, perhaps, of the intimate connection between Mr. Peters
and the family of John Winthrop, Jr., the name of the latter is to be
added to the cluster of eminent men who, at that time, were drawn to
reside in Salem. He was here, it is quite certain, from 1638 to 1641,
if not for a longer period. There are indications of his presence as
early as March of the former year, when he was appointed with Endicott
to administer the freeman's oath to his uncle Downing. On the 25th of
the next June, he had liberty to set up a salt-house at Royal Neck, on
the east side of Wooleston River. There he erected a dwelling-house
and other buildings, as appears by the depositions of sundry persons
in a land suit about thirty years afterwards, who state that they
worked for him, and were conversant with him there for several years.
His first experiments and enterprises in the salt-manufacture, which
he subsequently conducted on a very extensive scale in Connecticut,
were performed at Royal Neck. His daughter, the widow successively of
Antipas Newman and Zerubabel Endicott, in the suit just men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[i.59]</a></span>tioned,
recovered possession of that property, comprising forty acres, with
the buildings and improvements. In 1646, John Winthrop, Jr.,
accompanied by a brother of Hugh Peters, Rev. Thomas Peters from
Cornwall in England, began a plantation at Pequot River; and Trumbull,
in his &quot;History of Connecticut,&quot; says that &quot;Mr. Thomas Peters was the
first minister of Saybrook.&quot; The fortunes and families of Hugh Peters
and John Winthrop, Jr., seem all along to have been linked together.</p>

<p>Downing, Read, and Peters, three of the original planters of Salem
Farms, were drawn back to England and kept there by the engrossing
interest which the wonderful revolution then breaking out in that
kingdom could not but awaken in such minds as theirs. Here and
everywhere, a great check was given to the early progress of the
country by the turn of the tide which carried such men back to
England, and prevented others from coming over. If the Parliament had
not attempted to arrest the usurpations of the crown at that time, and
the Stuarts been suffered to establish an absolute monarchy, the eyes
and hearts of all free spirits would have remained fixed on America,
and a perpetual stream of emigration brought over, for generations and
for ever, thousands upon thousands of such men as came at the
beginning. The effects that would have been thus produced in America
and in England, in accelerating the progress of society here, and
sinking it into debasement there; and thereby upon the fortunes of
mankind the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[i.60]</a></span> over, is a subject on which a meditative and
philosophical mind may well be exercised.</p>

<p>But, although these men were lost, others are worthy of being
enumerated, in forming an estimate of the elements that went to make
the character of the people, a chapter in whose history, of awful
import, we are preparing ourselves to explore.</p>

<p>Francis Weston was a leading man at the very beginning. In 1634, with
Roger Conant and John Holgrave, he represented Salem in the first
House of Deputies ever assembled. His land grant was some little
distance to the west of the meeting-house of the village. He must have
been a person of more than ordinary liberality of spirit; for he
discountenanced the intolerance of his age, and kept his mind open to
receive truth and light. He did not conceal his sympathy with those
who suffered for entertaining Antinomian sentiments. He was ordered to
quit the colony in 1638. For the same offence, his wife, who probably
had refused to go, was placed in the stocks &quot;two hours at Boston and
two at Salem, on a lecture day.&quot; Weston, having ventured back, five
years afterwards, was put in irons, and imprisoned to hard labor. But,
as he stood to his principles, and there was danger to be apprehended
from his influence, he was again driven out of the colony.</p>

<p>Richard Waterman came over from England in 1629, recommended to
Governor Endicott by the governor and deputy in London. He was a noted
hunter. &quot;His chief employment,&quot; says the letter introducing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[i.61]</a></span> him to
Endicott, &quot;will be to get you good venison.&quot; A land grant was assigned
him near Davenport's Hill. But he, too, had a spirit that resisted the
severe and arbitrary policy of the times. He became a dissenter from
the prevalent creed, and sympathized with those who suffered
oppression. In 1664, he was brought before the court, condemned to
imprisonment, and finally banished. Weston and Waterman subsequently
were conspicuous in Rhode-Island affairs. While residing in the
village, the latter probably devoted himself to the opening of his
land, and the pursuit of game through the forests. I find but one
notice of him as connected with public affairs.</p>

<p>For some years, the settlements were necessarily confined to the
shores of bays or coves, and the banks of rivers. There were no
wheel-carriages of any kind, for transportation or travel, until
something like roads could be made; and that was the work of time. A
few horses had been imported; but it was long before they could be
raised to meet the general wants, or come much into use. Every thing
had to be water-borne. The only vehicles were boats or canoes, mostly
the latter. There were two kinds of canoes. Large white-pine logs were
scooped or hollowed out, and wrought into suitable shape, about two
and a half feet in breadth and twenty in length. These were often
quite convenient and serviceable, but not to be compared with the
Indian canoes, which were made of the bark of trees, wrought with
great skill into a beautiful shape. The birch canoe was an admirable
struc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[i.62]</a></span>ture, combining elements and principles which modern naval
architecture may well study to imitate. In lightness, rapidity,
freedom and ease of motion, it has not been, and cannot be, surpassed.
Its draft, even when bearing a considerable burden, was so slight,
that it would glide over the shallowest bars. It was strong, durable,
and easily kept in repair. Although dangerous to the highest degree
under an inexperienced and unskilful hand, no vessel has ever been
safer when managed by persons trained to its use. The cool and
quick-sighted Indian could guide it, with his exquisitely moulded
paddle, in perfect security, through whirling rapids and over heavy
seas, around headlands and across bays. The settlers early supplied
themselves with canoes, by which to thread the interior streams, and
cross from shore to shore in the harbors. One great advantage of the
light canoe, before roads were opened through the woods, was, that it
could be unloaded, and borne on the shoulders across the land, at any
point, to another stream or lake, thus cutting off long curves, and
getting from river to river. The lading would be transported in
convenient parcels, the canoe launched, loaded, and again be floated
on its way. Canoes soon came into universal use, particularly in this
neighborhood. Wood, in his &quot;New-England's Prospect,&quot; speaking of
Salem, says, &quot;There be more canowes in this town than in all the whole
Patent, every household having a water horse or two.&quot; It was so
important for the public safety to have them kept in good condition,
that the town took the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[i.63]</a></span> in hand. The quarterly court records
have the following entry under the date of June 27, 1636:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;It was ordered and agreed, that all the canoes of the north
side of the town shall be brought the next second day, being
the 4th day of the 5th month, about 9 o'clock,
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, unto the cove of the common landing place of
the North River, by George Harris his house&#8212;And that all
the canoes of the south side are to be brought before the
port-house in the South River, at the same time, then and
there to be viewed by J. Holgrave, P. Palfrey, R. Waterman,
R. Conant, P. Veren, or the greater number of them. And that
there shall be no canoe used (upon penalty, of forty
shillings, to the owner thereof) than such as the said
surveyors shall allow of and set their mark upon; and if any
shall refuse or neglect to bring their canoes to the said
places at the time appointed, they shall pay for said fault
10 shillings.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The names of the men associated with Waterman prove that he was ranked
among the chief citizens of the town. The austere manners of the age,
among communities like that established here; the exclusion, at that
time, by inexorable laws, of many forms of amusement; and the general
sombre aspect of society, kept down the natural exhilaration of life
to such a degree, that, when the pressure was occasionally removed,
the whole people bounded into the liveliest outbursts of glad
excitement. It was no doubt a gala day. Ceremony, sport, and
festivity, in all their forms, took full effect. The surveyors
performed their functions with the utmost display of authority,
examined the canoes with the gravest scrutiny, and affixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[i.64]</a></span> their
marks with all due formality. A light, graceful, and most picturesque
fleet swarmed, from all directions, to the appointed rendezvous. The
harbor glittered with the flashing paddles, and was the scene of swift
races and rival feats of skill, displaying manly strength and agility.
It must have been an aquatic spectacle of rare gayety and beauty, not
surpassed nor equalled in some respects, when, more than a century
afterwards, the &quot;Grand Turk&quot; or the &quot;Essex&quot; frigate was launched, or
when Commodore Forbes, still later, swept into our peaceful waters
with his boat flotilla. It was the first Fourth of July ever
celebrated in America.</p>

<p>Thomas Scruggs was an early inhabitant of Salem; often represented the
town as deputy in the General Court; was one of the judges of the
local court, and always recognized among the rulers of the town. In
January, 1636, he received a grant of three hundred acres on the
south-west limits of its territory. The next month, an exchange took
place, which is thus recorded in the town-book of grants: &quot;It was
ordered, that, whereas Mr. Scruggs had a farm of three hundred acres
beyond Forest River, and that Captain Trask had one of two hundred
acres beyond Bass River, and Captain Trask freely relinquishing his
farm of two hundred acres, it was granted unto Mr. Thomas Scruggs, and
he thereupon freely relinquished his farm of three hundred acres.&quot;
This brought Scruggs upon the Salem Farms, between Bass River and the
great pond, Wenham Lake. The real object in making this arrangement
was to advance a project which the lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[i.65]</a></span>ing people of Salem at that
time had much at heart. They were very desirous to have the college
established on the tract relinquished by Scruggs. What would have been
the effect of placing it there, in the immediate neighborhood of the
sea-shore, in full view of the spacious bay, its promontories,
islands, and navigation, is a question on which we may speculate at
our leisure. The effort failed: Captain Trask and Mr. Scruggs had done
all they could to accomplish it, and gave their energies to the
welfare of the community in other directions. From the little that is
recorded of Scruggs, it is quite evident that he was an intelligent
and valuable citizen. The event that brought his career as a public
man to a close proves that his mind was enlightened, liberal, and
independent; that he was in advance of the times in which he lived.
When the bitter and violent persecution of the celebrated Anne
Hutchinson, on account of her Antinomian sentiments, took place, Mr.
Scruggs disapproved and denounced it. He gave his whole influence,
earnestly and openly, against such attempts to suppress freedom of
inquiry and the rights of conscience. He, with others in Salem, was
proscribed, disarmed, and deprived of his public functions. He appears
to have been suffered to remain unmolested on his estate, and died
there in 1654. He had but one child, Rachel; and the name, as derived
from him, became extinct. The inventory of his property is dated on
the 24th of June of that year. The items mentioned in it amount to
&#163;244. 10<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> Consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[i.66]</a></span>ing the rates of value at that time, it
was a large property. At the same date, an agreement is recorded by
which his widow, Margery, conveys to her son-in-law, John Raymond, all
her real estate, upon these conditions: She to have the use of her
house during her life, the bedding, and other &quot;household stuff;&quot; and
he to pay her five pounds &quot;in hand,&quot; twenty pounds per annum, and five
pounds &quot;at the hour of her death.&quot; This was an ample provision, in
those times, for her comfort while she lived, and for her funeral
charges. I do not remember to have found this last point arranged for,
in such a form of expression, in any other instance.</p>

<p>William Alford was an early settler. He was a member of the numerous
and wealthy society, or guild, of Skinners, in the city of London, and
probably came here with the view of establishing an extensive trade in
furs. He received accordingly, in 1636, a grant of two hundred acres,
including what was for some time called Alford's Hill, afterwards Long
Hill, now known as Cherry Hill. It is owned and occupied by R.P.
Waters, Esq. Alford sympathized in religious views with his neighbor
Scruggs, and with him was subjected to censure, and disarmed by order
of the General Court. He sold his lands to Henry Herrick, and left the
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>One of the most enlightened, and perhaps most accomplished, men among
the first inhabitants of Salem Village, was Townsend Bishop. He was
admitted a freeman in 1635. The next year, he appears on the list of
members of the Salem Church. He was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[i.67]</a></span> of the judges of the local
court, and, almost without intermission from his first coming here, a
deputy to the General Court. In 1645, as his attention had been led to
the subject, he conceived doubts in reference to infant baptism; and
it was noticed that he did not bring forward a child, recently born,
to the rite. Although himself on the bench, and ever before the object
of popular favor and public honors, he was at once brought up, and
handed over for discipline. The next year, he sold his estates, and
probably removed elsewhere. He appears no more in our annals. Where he
went, I have not been able to learn. It is to be hoped that he found
somewhere a more congenial and tolerant abode. It is evident that he
could not breathe in an atmosphere of bigotry; and it was difficult to
find one free from the miasma in those days.</p>

<p>Five of the most valuable of the first settlers of the
village&#8212;Weston, Waterman, Scruggs, Alford, and Bishop&#8212;were thus
early driven into exile, or subdued to silence, by the stern policy on
which the colony was founded. It is an error to characterize this as
religious bigotry. It was not so much a theological as a political
persecution. Its apparent form was in reference to tenets of faith,
but the policy was deeper than this. Any attempt to make opposition to
the existing administration was treated with equal severity, whatever
might be the subject on which it ventured to display itself.</p>

<p>The men who sought this far-off &quot;nook and corner of the world,&quot;
crossing a tempestuous and dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[i.68]</a></span> ocean, and landing on the shores
of a wilderness, leaving every thing, however dear and valuable,
behind, came to have a country and a social system for themselves and
of themselves alone. Their resolve was inexorable not to allow the
mother-country, or the whole outside world combined, to interfere with
them. And it was equally inexorable not to suffer dissent or any
discordant element to get foothold among them. Sir Christopher
Gardner's rank and title could not save him: he was not of the sort
they wanted, and they shipped him back. Roger Williams's virtues,
learning, apostolic piety, could not save him; and they drove him into
a wintry wilderness, hunting him beyond their borders. It was not so
much a question whether Baptists, Antinomians, or Quakers were right
or wrong, as a preformed determination not to have any dissentients of
any description among them. They had sacrificed all to find and to
make a country for themselves, and they meant to keep it to
themselves. They had gone out of everybody else's way, and they did
not mean to let anybody else come into their way. They did not
understand the great truth which Hugh Peters preached to Parliament,
&quot;Why,&quot; said he, &quot;cannot Christians differ, and yet be friends? All
children should be fed, though they have different faces and shapes:
unity, not uniformity, is the Christian word.&quot; They admitted no such
notion as this. They thought uniformity the only basis of unity. They
meant to make and to keep this a country after their own pattern, a
Congregational, Puritan, Cambridge-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[i.69]</a></span>Platform-man's country. The time
has not yet come when we can lift up clean hands against them. Two
successive chief-magistrates of the United States have opened the door
and signified to one-eighth part of our whole people, that it will be
best for them to walk out. So long as the doctrine is maintained that
this is the white man's country, or any man's, or any class or kind of
men's country, it becomes us to close our lips against denunciation of
the Fathers of New England because they tried to keep the country to
themselves. The sentiment or notion on which they acted, in whatever
form it appears, however high the station from which it emanates, or
however long it lasts in the world, is equally false and detestable in
all its shapes. It is a defiant rebellion against that law which
declares that &quot;all nature's difference is all nature's peace;&quot; that
there can be no harmony without variety of sound, no social unity
without unlimited freedom, and no true liberty where any are deprived
of equal rights; that differences ought to bring men together, rather
than keep them apart; and that the only government that can stand
against the shocks of time, and grow stronger and dearer to all its
people, is one that recognizes no differences of whatever kind among
them. The only consistent or solid foundation on which a republic or a
church can be built, is an absolute level, with no enclosures and no
exclusion.</p>

<p>Townsend Bishop's grant of three hundred acres was made on the 16th of
January, 1636. When he sold it, Oct. 18, 1641, it appears by the deed,
that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[i.70]</a></span> were on it edifices, gardens, yards, enclosures, and
meadows. A large force must have been put and kept upon it, from the
first, to have produced such results in so short a time. Orchards had
been planted. The manner in which the grounds were laid out is still
indicated by embankments, with artificial slopes and roadways, which
exhibit the fine taste of the proprietor, and must have required a
large expenditure of money and labor. Although the estate has always
been in the hands of owners competent to take care of it and keep it
in good preservation, none but the original proprietor would have been
likely to have made the outlay apparent on its face, on the plan
adopted. The mansion in which he resided stands to-day. Its front,
facing the south, has apparently been widened, at some remote
intermediate date since its original erection, by a slight extension
on the western end, beyond the porch. It has been otherwise, perhaps,
somewhat altered in the course of time by repairs; but its general
aspect, as exhibited in the <a href="#townsend">frontispiece</a> of this volume, and its
original strongly compacted and imperishable frame, remain. No saw was
used in shaping its timbers; they were all hewn, by the broad-axe, of
the most durable oak: they are massive, and rendered by time as hard
to penetrate almost as iron. The walls and stairway of the cellar, the
entrance to which is seen by the side of the porch, constructed of
such stones as could be gathered on the surface of a new country, bear
the marks of great antiquity. A long, low kitchen, with a stud of
scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[i.71]</a></span> six feet, extended originally the whole length of the
lean-to, on the north side of the house. The rooms of the main house
were of considerably higher stud. The old roadway, the outlines of
which still remain, approached the house from the east, came up to its
north-east corner, wound round its front, and continued from its
north-west corner, on a track still visible, over a brook and through
the apple-orchard planted by Bishop, to the point where the
burial-ground of the village now is; and so on towards the lands then
occupied by Richard Hutchinson, also to the lands afterwards owned by
Nathaniel Ingersol, towards Beaver Dam, and the first settlements in
that direction and to the westward. In general it may be said, that
the structural proportions and internal arrangements of the house,
taken in its relations to the vestiges and indications on the face of
the grounds, show that it is coeval with the first occupancy of the
farm. But we do not depend, in this case, upon conjectural
considerations, or on mere tradition, which, on such a point, is not
always reliable. It happens to be demonstrated, that this is the
veritable house built and occupied by Townsend Bishop, in 1636, by a
singular and irrefragable chain of specific proof. A protracted land
suit, hereafter to be described, gave rise to a great mass of papers,
which are preserved in the files of the county courts and the State
Department; among them are several plots made by surveyors, and
adduced in evidence by the parties. Not only the locality but a
diagram of the house, as then standing, are given.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[i.72]</a></span> The spot on which
it stood is shown. Further, it appears, that in the deeds of
transference of the estate, the homestead is specially described as
the house in which Townsend Bishop lived, called &quot;Bishop's Mansion.&quot;
This continues to a period subsequent to the style of its
architecture, and within recent tradition and the memory of the
living. In the old Salem Commoner's records, it is called &quot;Bishop's
Cottage,&quot; which was the name generally given to dwelling-houses in
those early times. Having, as occasion required, been seasonably
repaired, it is as strong and good a house to-day as can be found. Its
original timbers, if kept dry and well aired, are beyond decay; and it
may stand, a useful, eligible, and comely residence, through a future
as long as the past. It may be doubted whether any dwelling-house now
in use in this country can be carried back, by any thing like a
similar strength of evidence, to an equal antiquity. Its site, in
reference to the surrounding landscape, was well chosen. Here its
hospitable and distinguished first proprietor lived, in the interims
of his public and official service, in peace and tranquillity, until
ferreted out by the intrusive spirit of an intolerant age. Here he
welcomed his neighbors,&#8212;Endicott, Downing, Peters, John Winthrop,
Jr., Read, and other kindred spirits.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[i.73]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of a mysterious providence, this venerable mansion was
destined to be rendered mem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[i.74]</a></span>orable by its connection with the darkest
scene in our annals. As that scene cannot otherwise be comprehended in
all the elements that led to it, it is necessary to give the
intermediate history of the Townsend Bishop farm and mansion. In 1641,
Bishop sold it to Henry Chickering, who seems to have been residing
for some time in Salem, and to whom, in January, 1640, a grant of land
had been made by the town. He continued to own it until the 4th of
October, 1648; although he does not appear to have resided on the farm
long, as he soon removed to Dedham, from which place he was deputy to
the General Court in 1642, and several years afterwards. He sold the
farm at the above-mentioned date to Governor Endicott for one hundred
and sixty pounds. In 1653, John Endicott, Jr., the eldest son of the
Governor, married Elizabeth, daughter of Jeremiah Houchins, an eminent
citizen of Boston, who had before resided in Hingham, which place he
represented as deputy for six years. The name was pronounced
&quot;Houkins,&quot; and so perhaps was finally spelled &quot;Hawkins.&quot; By agreement,
or &quot;articles of marriage contract,&quot; Endicott bestowed the farm upon
his son. &quot;Present possession&quot; was given. How long, or how much of the
time, the young couple lived on the estate, is not known. Their
principal residence was in Boston. The General Court, in 1660, granted
John Endicott,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[i.75]</a></span> Jr., four hundred acres of land on the eastern side of
the upper part of Merrimac River. After the purchase of the farm from
Chickering, the Endicott property covered nearly a thousand acres in
one tract, extending from the arms of the sea to the centre of the
present village of Tapleyville. On the 10th of May, 1662, the Governor
executed a deed, carrying out the engagements of the marriage
contract, giving to his son John, his heirs, and assigns for ever, the
Bishop farm. Governor Endicott died in 1665. A will was found signed
and sealed by him, dated May 2, 1659, in which, referring to the
marriage gift to John, he bequeathes the aforesaid farm to &quot;him and
his heirs,&quot; but does not add, &quot;and assigns.&quot; Another item of the will
is, &quot;The land I have bequeathed to my two sons, in one place or
another, my will is that the longest liver of them shall enjoy the
whole, except the Lord send them children to inherit it after them.&quot;
Unfortunately, there were no witnesses to the will. It was not allowed
in Probate. The matter was carried up to the General Court; and it was
decided Aug. 1, 1665, that the court &quot;do not approve of the instrument
produced in court to be the last will and testament of the late John
Endicott, Esq., governor.&quot; In October of the same year, John Endicott,
Jr., petitioned the General Court to act on the settlement of his
father's estate; and the court directs administration to be granted to
&quot;Mrs. Elizabeth Endicott and her two sons, John and Zerubabel,&quot; and
that they bring in an inventory to the next county court at Boston,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[i.76]</a></span> to dispose of the same as the law directs. Upon this, the widow
of the Governor, and his son Zerubabel, again appeal to the General
Court; and on the 23d of May, 1666, &quot;after a full hearing of all
parties concerned in the said estate, i.e., the said Mrs. Elizabeth
Endicott and her two sons, Mr. John and Mr. Zerubabel Endicott, Mr.
Jeremiah Houchin being also present in court, and respectively
presenting their pleas and evidences in the case,&quot; it was finally
decided and ordered by the court, that the provisions of the document
purporting to be the will of Governor Endicott should be carried into
effect, with these exceptions: that the Bishop or Chickering farm
shall go to his son John &quot;to him, his heirs and assigns for ever;&quot; and
that Elizabeth, the wife of said son John, if she should survive her
husband, shall enjoy during her life all the estate of her husband in
all the other houses and lands mentioned in the instrument purporting
to be his father's will. The court adjudge that this must have been
&quot;the real intent of the aforesaid John Endicott, Esq., deceased, who
had during his life special favor and respect for her.&quot; They give the
widow of the Governor &quot;the goods and chattels&quot; of the said John
Endicott, Esq., her late husband, provided that, if &quot;she shall die
seized to the value of more than eighty pounds sterling&quot; thereof, the
surplus shall be divided between her two sons: John to have a double
portion thereof. Finally, they appoint the widow sole administratrix,
and require her to bring in a true inventory to the next court for the
county of Suffolk, and to pay all debts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[i.77]</a></span></p>

<p>John and his father-in-law had it all their own way. The decision of
the court was perhaps correct, according to legal principles; although
it is not so certain that it was, in all respects, in conformity with
the intent of Governor Endicott. Undoubtedly, as the language of the
deed shows, he had made up his mind to give to his son John and &quot;his
assigns&quot; absolute, full, and final possession of the Bishop farm. But
it seems equally certain, that he meant to have the rest of his landed
estate, including the Orchard Farm and the Ipswich-river farm, go
directly and wholly to the survivor, if either of his sons died
without issue. The facts and dates are as follows: His son John was
married in 1653. The Governor's will was made in 1659. It had then
become quite probable that John might not have issue. The will gives
him and his heirs, but not his assigns, the Bishop farm. In the event
of his death without issue, his widow would have her dower and legal
life right in it, but the final heir would be Zerubabel. In 1662, the
Governor, who had, some years before, removed to Boston, where he
resided the remainder of his life, executed a deed, giving to his son
John, &quot;his heirs and assigns,&quot; a full and permanent title to the
Bishop farm. This was a variation of the plan for the disposition of
his estate as shown in his will. He probably designed to make a new
will, securing to his natural heirs, so far as his other landed
property was concerned, what he had thus permitted to pass away from
them in the Bishop farm; that is, the full and immediate possession
by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[i.78]</a></span> the survivor, if either of the sons died without issue. It was a
favorite idea, almost a sacred principle, in those days, to have lands
go in the natural descent. The sentiment is quite apparent in the
tenor of the Governor's will. When he deprived, by his deed to John in
1662, Zerubabel's family of the right to the final possession of the
Bishop farm, it can hardly be doubted that he relied upon the
provisions of his will to secure to them the immediate, complete
possession of all his other lands, without the incumbrance of any
claim of dower or otherwise of John's widow. But the pressure of
public duties prevented his duly executing his will, and putting it
into a new shape, in conformity with the circumstances of the case.
The troubles that followed teach the necessity of the utmost caution
and carefulness in that most difficult and most irremediable of all
business transactions,&#8212;the attempt to continue the control of
property, after death, by written instruments.</p>

<p>John Endicott, Jr., died in February, 1668, without issue; leaving his
whole estate to his widow, &quot;her heirs and assigns for ever.&quot; His will
is dated Jan. 27, 1668, and was offered to Probate on the 29th of
February, 1668. His widow married, Aug. 31, 1668, the Rev. James
Allen, one of the ministers of the First Church in Boston, whose
previous wife, Hannah Dummer, by whom he received five hundred acres
of land, had died in March, 1668. His Endicott wife died April 5,
1673, leaving the Townsend-Bishop farm and all her other property to
him; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[i.79]</a></span> on the 11th of September, of the same year, he married Sarah
Hawlins. By his two preceding wives he received twelve hundred acres
of land. How much he got by the last-mentioned, we have no
information. Besides these matrimonial accumulations, the accounts
seem to indicate that he was rich before.</p>

<p>It may well be imagined, that it could not have been very agreeable to
the family at the Orchard Farm to see this choice and extensive
portion of their estate, which was within full view from their
windows, swept into the hands of utter strangers in so rapid and
extraordinary a manner, by a series of circumstances most distasteful
and provoking. But this was but the beginning of their trouble.</p>

<p>On the 29th of April, 1678, Allen sold the Bishop farm to Francis
Nurse, of the town of Salem, for four hundred pounds. Nurse was an
early settler, and, before this purchase, had lived, for some forty
years, &quot;near Skerry's,&quot; on the North River, between the main part of
the settlement in the town of Salem and the ferry to Beverly. He is
described as a &quot;tray-maker.&quot; The making of these articles, and similar
objects of domestic use, was an important employment in a new country
remote from foreign supply. He appears to have been a very respectable
person, of great stability and energy of character, whose judgment was
much relied on by his neighbors. No one is mentioned more frequently
as umpire to settle disputes, or arbitrator to adjust conflicting
claims. He was often on committees to determine boundaries or
estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[i.80]</a></span> valuations, or on local juries to lay out highways and
assess damages. The fact that he was willing to encounter the
difficulties connected with such a heavy transaction as the purchase
of the Bishop farm at such a price at his time of life proves that he
had a spirit equal to a bold undertaking. He was then fifty-eight
years of age. His wife Rebecca was fifty-seven years of age. We shall
meet her again.</p>

<p>They had four sons,&#8212;Samuel, John, Francis, and Benjamin; and four
daughters,&#8212;Rebecca, married to Thomas Preston, Mary to John Tarbell,
Elizabeth to William Russell, and Sarah, who remained unmarried until
after the death of her mother. With this strong force of stalwart sons
and sons-in-law, and their industrious wives, Francis Nurse took hold
of the farm. The terms of the purchase were so judicious and
ingenious, that they are worthy of being related, and show in what
manner energetic and able-bodied men, even if not possessed of
capital, particularly if they could command an effective co-operation
in the labor of their families, obtained possession of valuable landed
estates. The purchase-money was not required to be paid until the
expiration of twenty-one years. In the mean time, a moderate annual
rent was fixed upon; seven pounds for each of the first twelve years,
and ten pounds for each of the remaining nine years. If, at the end of
the time, the amount stipulated had not been paid, or Nurse should
abandon the undertaking, the property was to relapse to Allen.
Disinterested and suitable men, whose appointment was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[i.81]</a></span> provided for,
were then to estimate the value added to the estate by Nurse during
his occupancy, by the clearing of meadows or erection of buildings or
other permanent improvements, and all of that value over and above one
hundred and fifty pounds was to be paid to him. If any part of the
principal sum should be paid prior to the expiration of twenty-one
years, a proportionate part of the farm was to be relieved of all
obligation to Allen, vest absolutely in Nurse, and be disposable by
him. By these terms, Allen felt authorized to fix a very high price
for the farm, it not being payable until the lapse of a long period of
time. If not paid at all, the property would come back to him, with
one hundred and fifty pounds of value added to it. It was not a bad
bargain for him,&#8212;a man of independent means derived from other
sources, and so situated as not to be able to carry on the farm
himself. It was a good investment ahead. To Nurse the terms were most
favorable. He did not have to pay down a dollar at the start. The low
rent required enabled him to apply almost the entire income from the
farm to improvements that would make it more and more productive.
Before half the time had elapsed, a value was created competent to
discharge the whole sum due to Allen. His children severally had good
farms within the bounds of the estate, were able to assume with ease
their respective shares of the obligations of the purchase; and the
property was thus fully secured within the allotted time. Allen gave,
at the beginning, a full deed, in the ordinary form, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[i.82]</a></span> was
recorded in this county. Nurse gave a duly executed bond, in which the
foregoing conditions are carefully and clearly defined. That was
recorded in Suffolk County; and nothing, perhaps, was known in the
neighborhood, at the time or ever after, of the terms of the
transaction. When the success of the enterprise was fully secured,
Nurse conveyed to his children the larger half of the farm, reserving
the homestead and a convenient amount of land in his own possession.
The plan of this division shows great fairness and judgment, and was
entirely satisfactory to them all. They were required, by the deeds he
gave them, to maintain a roadway by which they could communicate with
each other and with the old parental home.</p>

<p>Here the venerable couple were living in truly patriarchal style,
occupying the &quot;mansion&quot; of Townsend Bishop, when the witchcraft
delusion occurred. They and their children were all clustered within
the limits of the three-hundred-acre farm. They were one family. The
territory was their own, secured by their united action, and made
commodious, productive, valuable, and beautiful to behold, by their
harmonious, patient, and persevering labor. Each family had a
homestead, and fields and gardens; and children were growing up in
every household. The elder sons and sons-in-law had become men of
influence in the affairs of the church and village. It was a scene of
domestic happiness and prosperity rarely surpassed. The work of life
having been successfully done, it seemed that a peaceful and serene
descent into the vale of years was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[i.83]</a></span> secured to Francis and Rebecca
Nurse. But far otherwise was the allotment of a dark and inscrutable
providence.</p>

<p>There is some reason to suspect that the prosperity of the Nurses had
awakened envy and jealousy among the neighbors. The very fact that
they were a community of themselves and by themselves, may have
operated prejudicially. To have a man, who, for forty years, had been
known, in the immediate vicinity, as a farmer and mechanic on a small
scale, without any pecuniary means, get possession of such a property,
and spread out his family to such an extent, was inexplicable to all,
and not relished perhaps by some. There seems to have been a
disposition to persist in withholding from him the dignity of a
landholder; and, long after he had distributed his estate among his
descendants, it is mentioned in deeds made by parties that bounded
upon it, as &quot;the farm which Mr. Allen, of Boston, lets to the Nurses.&quot;
Not knowing probably any thing about it, they call it, even after
Nurse's death, &quot;Mr. Allen's farm.&quot; This, however, was a slight matter.
When Allen sold the farm to Nurse, he bound himself to defend the
title; and he was true to his bond. What was required to be done in
this direction may, perhaps, have exposed the Nurses to animosities
which afterwards took terrible effect against them.</p>

<p>In granting lands originally, neither the General Court nor the town
exercised sufficient care to define boundaries. There does not appear
to have been any well-arranged system, based upon elaborate,
accurate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[i.84]</a></span> scientific surveys. Of the dimensions of the area of a
rough, thickly wooded, unfrequented country, the best estimates of the
most practised eyes, and measurements resting on mere exploration or
perambulation, are very unreliable. The consequence was, that, in many
cases, grants were found to overlap each other. This was the case with
the Bishop farm; and soon after Nurse came into possession, and had
begun to operate upon it, a conflict commenced; trespasses were
complained of; suits were instituted; and one of the most memorable
and obstinately contested land-controversies known to our courts took
place. In that controversy Nurse was not formally a principal. The
case was between James Allen and Zerubabel Endicott, or between Allen
and Nathaniel Putnam.</p>

<p>An inspection of the <a href="#map">map</a>, at this point, will enable us to understand
the grounds on which the suit was contested. The Orchard Farm was
granted to Endicott, as has been stated, July 3, 1632, by the General
Court. The grant states the bounds on the south and on the north to be
two rivers; on the east, another river, into which they both flow;
and, on the west, the mainland. Where this western line was to strike
the rivers on the north and south is not specified; but the natural
interpretation would seem to be, in the absence of any thing to the
contrary, that it was to strike them at their respective heads. The
evidence of all persons who were conversant with the premises during
the life of the Governor as connected with the farm was unanimous and
conclusive to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[i.85]</a></span> this point; that is, that he and they always supposed
that the west line was, as drawn on the <a href="#map">map</a>, from the head of one
river to the head of the other; that the farm embraced all between
them as far up as the tide set. It was objected, on the other side,
that this made the farm much more than three hundred acres; but as an
offset to that was the fact, that a considerable part of the area was
swamp or marsh, not usually taken into the account in reckoning the
extent of a grant, and the additional fact, that the language of the
General Court in reference to quantity was not precise,&#8212;&quot;about&quot; three
hundred acres. At the same date with the grant to Endicott, the
General Court granted two hundred acres to Mr. Skelton, which tract is
given on the <a href="#map">map</a>.</p>

<p>As has been stated, the General Court conferred upon the towns the
exclusive right to dispose of the lands within their limits, March 3,
1635. On the 10th of December of that year, the town of Salem granted
to Robert Cole the tract of three hundred acres subsequently purchased
by Emanuel Downing, which is indicated on the <a href="#map">map</a>. On the 11th of
January, 1636, the grant of three hundred acres was made to Townsend
Bishop. Its language is unfortunately obscure in some expressions; but
it is clear, that the tract was to be four hundred rods in length, one
hundred and twenty-four rods in width at the western end, and one
hundred and sixteen rods at the eastern. At the north-east corner it
was to meet the water or brook that separated it from the grant to
Skelton; and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[i.86]</a></span> was also to &quot;but&quot; upon, or touch, at the eastern end,
the land granted to Endicott by the General Court. After the grant to
Bishop, the town, from time to time, made grants to Stileman of land
north of the Bishop grant. Stileman's grants adjoined Skelton's at the
north-eastern corner of the Bishop farm. That part of Stileman's land
had come into possession of Nathaniel Putnam, and the residue
westwardly, together with the grant to Weston, into the possession of
Hutchinson, Houlton, and Ingersol. Still further west, the town had
made grants to Swinnerton. Their respective locations are given in the
<a href="#map">map</a>. The point of difficulty which gave rise to litigation was this:
The Bishop farm was required, by the terms of the grant, to be one
hundred and sixteen rods wide at its eastern end. But there was no
room for it. The requisite width could not be got without encroaching
upon either Putnam or Endicott, or both. As Endicott stood upon an
earlier title than that of Bishop, and from a higher authority, and
Putnam upon a later title from an inferior authority, the court of
trials might have disposed of the matter, at the opening, on that
ground, and Putnam been left to suffer the encroachment. But it did
not so decide; and the case went on. The struggle was between Endicott
to push it north, and thereby save his Orchard Farm, and the land
between it and the Bishop grant, given by the town to his father,
called the Governor's Plain, and Nathaniel Putnam to push it south,
and thereby save the land he had received from his wife's father,
Rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[i.87]</a></span>ard Hutchinson, who had purchased from Stileman. Allen stood on
the defensive against both of them. The Nurses had nothing to do but
to attend to their own business, carrying on their farming operations
up to the limits of their deed, looking to Allen for redress, if, in
the end, the dimensions of their estate should be curtailed. But,
being the occupants, and, until finally ousted, the owners of the
land, if there was any intrusion to be repelled, or violence to be
met, or fighting to be done, they were the ones to do it. They were
equal to the situation.</p>

<p>After various trials in the courts of law in all possible shapes, the
whole subject was carried up to the General Court, where it was
decided, in conformity with the report of a special commission in May,
1679, substantially in favor of Putnam and Allen. Endicott petitioned
for a new hearing. Another commission was appointed; and their report
was accepted in May, 1682. It was more unfavorable to Endicott than
the previous one. He protested against the judgment of the court in
earnest but respectful language, and petitioned for still another
hearing. They again complied with his request, and appointed a day for
once more examining the case; but, when the day came, Nov. 24, 1683,
he was sick in bed, and the case was settled irrevocably against him.</p>

<p>The <a href="#map">map</a> gives the lines of the Bishop farm as finally settled by the
General Court. It will be noticed, that it is laid directly across the
Governor's Plain, and runs far into the Orchard Farm &quot;up to the rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[i.88]</a></span>
near Endicott's dwelling-house,&quot; or, as it is otherwise stated,
&quot;within a few rods of Guppy's ditch, near to&quot; the said house. It may
be said to have been a necessity, as the original three hundred acres
of the grant to Townsend Bishop had to be made up. It could not go
north; for Houlton and Ingersol stood upon the Weston grant, and
Hutchinson and Nathaniel Putnam stood upon Stileman's grants, to push
it back. It could not go west or south-west, for there Swinnerton
stood to fend off upon his grants; and there, too, was Nathaniel
Putnam, upon his own grant, and lands he had purchased of another
original grantee. It could not be swung round to the south without
jamming up the lands of Felton and others, or pushing them over the
grants, made to Robert Cole&#8212;under which Downing had purchased&#8212;and to
Thomas Read. All these parties were combined to force it
south-eastwardly over the grounds of Endicott. Nathaniel Putnam was
his most fatal antagonist. He was a man of remarkable energy, of
consummate adroitness, and untiring resources in such a transaction;
and he so managed to press in the bounds of the Bishop farm, at the
north-east, as to gain a valuable strip for himself. With this strong
man against him, acting in combination with the rich and influential
James Allen, minister of the great metropolitan First Church, and
licenser of the press, who brought the whole power of his clerical and
social connections in Boston and throughout the colony to bear upon
the General Court, Zerubabel Endicott had no chance for justice, and
no redress for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[i.89]</a></span> wrong. In vain he invoked the memory of his father, or
of Winthrop, the grandfather of his wife. His father and both the
Winthrops had long before left the scene: a new generation had risen,
and there was none to help him.</p>

<p>One would have supposed, that the General Court, which had granted the
Orchard Farm to Governor Endicott, would have felt bound, in
self-respect and in honor, to have protected it against any
overlapping grants subsequently made by an inferior authority. Under
the circumstances of the case, it was its duty to have held the
Orchard Farm intact, and made it up to the satisfaction of Allen and
Nurse by a grant elsewhere, or an equitable compensation in money. It
owed so much to the son of Endicott and the grand-daughter of
Winthrop, the first noble Fathers of the colony. Perhaps the court
found its justification in the phraseology of the deed of conveyance
of the Bishop farm from Governor Endicott to his son John. After
reciting or referring to the original town grant to Bishop, and the
deeds from Bishop to Chickering, and from Chickering to himself, the
Governor conveys to his son John all the houses, &amp;c., and every part
and parcel of the land &quot;to the utmost extent thereof, according as is
expressed or included in either of the forecited deeds, or town
grant.&quot; It was maintained, and justly, by Allen, that he held all that
was conveyed to John Endicott, Jr. But the Court had no right to
encroach upon the Orchard Farm, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[i.90]</a></span> been granted to the
Governor by them prior to all deeds and to the town grant to Bishop.</p>

<p>Never did that deep and sagacious observation on the mysteries of
human nature, &quot;Men's judgments are a parcel of their fortunes,&quot;
receive a more striking or melancholy illustration than in the case of
Zerubabel Endicott. With his falling fortunes, his judgment and
discretion fell also; his mind, maddened by a sense of wrong, seemed
bent upon exposing itself to new wrongs. Having been broken down by
lawsuits, that had wasted his estate, he seemed to have acquired a
blind passion for them. Having destroyed his peace and embarrassed his
affairs in attempts to resist the adjudications of the Court, he
persisted in struggling against them. He had tried to push the Bishop
grant west, over the land of Nathaniel Putnam in that quarter. The
highest tribunal had settled it against him. But he appeared to be
incapable of realizing the fact. He sent his hired men to cut timber
on that land. They worked there some days, felled a large number of
trees, and hewed them into beams and joists for the frame of a house.
One morning, returning to their work, there was no timber to be found;
logs, framework, and all, were gone. They were carefully piled up a
mile away, by the side of Putnam's dwelling-house, who had sent two
teams, one of four oxen, the other of two oxen and a horse, with an
adequate force of men, and in two loadings had cleaned out the whole.
Endicott of course sued him, and of course was cast.</p>

<p>When the General Court had consented to give him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[i.91]</a></span> a rehearing of the
case of the Bishop farm, they expressly forbade his making any &quot;strip&quot;
of the land in the mean while. But with the infatuation which seemed
to possess him, and not heeding how fatally it would prejudice his
cause at the impending hearing to violate the order of the Court, he
again sent a gang of men to cut wood on the land in controversy. The
following shows the result:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Hugh Jones, aged 46 years, and Alexius Reinolds, aged 25
years, testify and say, that we, these deponents, being
desired by Mr. Zerubabel Endicott to cut up some wood, for
his winter firewood, accordingly went with our teams, which
had four oxen and a horse; and there we met with several
other teams of our neighbors, which were upon the same
account, that is to say, to help carry up Mr. Endicott some
wood for his winter firewood, and when we had loaded our
sleds, Thomas Preston and John Tarbell came in a violent
manner, and hauled the wood out of our sleds; and Francis
Nurse, being present, demanded whose men we were. Mr.
Endicott, being present, answered, they were his men.&quot;</p></div>

<p>These witnesses testify that this &quot;battle of the wilderness&quot; lasted
two days,&#8212;Endicott's men cutting the wood and loading the teams, and
Nurse's men pitching it off. The altercations and conflicts that took
place between the parties during those two days may easily be
imagined. Whether there was a final, decisive pitched battle, we are
not informed. Perhaps there was. The woods rang with rough echoes, we
may be well assured. A lawsuit followed; the result could not be in
doubt. Endicott had no right there;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[i.92]</a></span> he was there in direct violation
of the order of Court. Nurse was in possession, had a right, and was
bound, to keep the land from being stripped.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Endicott broke down, under the difficulties that
had accumulated around him. On the 24th of November, 1683, as we have
seen, he was &quot;sick in bed.&quot; Two days before,&#8212;that is, on the 22d of
November,&#8212;he had made his will, which was presented in court on the
27th of March, 1684. He was game to the last; for this is an item of
the will:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Whereas my late father, by his last will, bequeathed to me
his farm called Bishop's or Chickering's farm, I do give the
said farm to my five sons, to be equally divided among
them.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The will of his father had been declared invalid on that point, and
others. The whole thing had been conclusively settled for years; but
he never would recognize the fact. It is a singular instance of an
obstinacy of will completely superseding and suppressing the reason
and the judgment. He lost the perception of the actual and real, in
clinging to what he felt to be the right.</p>

<p>Every association and sentiment of his soul had been shocked by the
wrongs he had suffered. He could not walk over his fields, or look
from his windows, without feeling that a property which his father had
given to his brother had, in a manner that he knew would have been as
odious to that father as it was to him, passed into the hands of
strangers, and been used as a wedge on which everybody had conspired
to deal blows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[i.93]</a></span> driving it into the centre of his patrimonial acres,
splitting and rending them through and through. He brooded over the
thought, until, whenever his mind was turned to it, his reason was
dethroned, his heart broken, and under its weight he fell into his
grave.</p>

<p>An argument addressed by him to the court and jury, in one of the
innumerable trials of the Bishop-farm case, is among the papers on
file. It appears to be a verbatim report of the speech as it was
delivered at the time, and proves him to have been a man of talents.
It is courteous, gentlemanly, and, I might say, scholarly in its
diction and style, skilful in its statements, and forcible in its
arguments.</p>

<p>In all the earlier trials, the juries uniformly gave verdicts in favor
of Endicott; but Allen carried the cases up to the General Court,
which exercised a final and unrestrained jurisdiction in all matters
referred to it. It usually appointed committees or commissioners to
examine such questions, accepted their reports, and made them binding.
Lands were thus disposed of without the agency, and against the
decisions, of juries. In his arguments addressed to the General Court,
Zerubabel Endicott protested against this jurisdiction, by which his
lands were taken from him &quot;by a committee, in an arbitrary way, being
neither bound nor sworn by law or evidence.&quot; He boldly denounced it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;To be disseized of my inheritance; to be judged by three or
four committee-men, who are neither bound to law nor
evidence,&#8212;who are, or may be, mutable in their
apprehensions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[i.94]</a></span> doing one thing to-day, and soon again
undoing what they did,&#8212;I conceive, to be judged in such an
arbitrary way is repugnant to the fundamental law of England
contained in Magna Charta, chap. 29, which says no freeman
shall be disseized of his freehold but by the lawful
judgment of his peers,&#8212;that is to say, by due process of
law; which was also confirmed by the Petition of Right, by
Act of Parliament, <i>tertio Caroli I</i>. And also such
arbitrary jurisdiction was exploded in putting down the
Star-Chamber Court; and the excessive fines imposed upon all
such actings. See 'English Liberties,' as also the fourth
and sixth articles against the Earl of Strafford in Baker's
'Chronicle,' folio 518.&quot;</p></div>

<p>He closes one of his remonstrances thus:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;The humble request of your petitioner to the Hon. Gen.
Court, that, as an Englishman,&#8212;as a freeman of this
jurisdiction; as descended from him who, in his time, sought
the welfare of this commonwealth,&#8212;I may have the benefit
and protection of the wholesome laws established in this
jurisdiction: that, in my extreme wrong, I may have liberty
to seek relief in a way of law, and may not, contrary to
Magna Charta, be disseized of my freehold by the arbitrary
act of two or three committee-men; the fundamental law of
England knowing no such constitution, abhorring such
administrations: and that the Hon. Court would release your
petitioner from the injurious effects of the said
committee's act, and explode so pernicious a precedent.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Zerubabel Endicott was an imprudent and obstinate man, but had the
traits of a generous, ardent, and noble character. He was a physician
by profession. His second wife&#8212;the widow, as has been stated, of Rev.
Antipas Newman, of Wenham, and daughter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[i.95]</a></span> John Winthrop, Jr.,
governor of Connecticut&#8212;survived him. Although he left five sons, the
name, at one time, was borne by a single descendant only, a lad of
seven years of age,&#8212;Samuel, a grandson of Zerubabel. On him it hung
suspended, but he saved it. From that boy, those who bear the name in
New England have been derived. We rejoice to believe that they will
preserve it, and keep its honor bright.</p>

<p>Winthrop was recognized as the great leader in the early history of
the Colony. He had a combination of qualities that marked him as a
wise and good man, and gave him precedence. The eminent dignity of his
character was admired and revered by all. No one was more ready to
admit this than Endicott. Never were men placed towards each other in
relations more severely testing their magnanimity, and none ever bore
the test more perfectly. But Endicott was, after all, the most
complete representative man of that generation. He was thoroughly
identified with the people, participating in their virtues and in
their defects. He was a strict religionist, a sturdy Puritan, a firm
administrator of the law; at the same time, there are indications that
he was of a genial spirit. He was personally brave, and officially
intrepid. His administration of the government required nerve, and he
had it. Sometimes the ardor of his temperament put him for a moment
off his guard; but he was quick to acknowledge his error. He was true
to the people, who never faltered in their fidelity to him. The author
of &quot;Wonder-working Providence&quot; de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[i.96]</a></span>scribed him as &quot;a fit instrument to
begin the wilderness worke, of courage bold undaunted, yet sociable
and of a cheerful spirit.&quot; I have presented some instances of his kind
and pleasant relations with his workmen and neighbors. His name will
ever be held in honored remembrance in this vicinity, where his useful
enterprise was appreciated; and his descendants in our day, and to the
present time, have contributed to the prosperity and the adornment of
the community.</p>

<p>It is not unlikely, that hostile feelings towards the Nurses, which
contributed afterwards to serious results, may have been engendered in
this long-continued land quarrel. There is evidence that no such
feeling existed on the part of the Endicotts: but there were many
others interested; for, by testimony at the trials and in outside
discussions, the whole community had become more or less implicated in
the strife. The Nurses, as holding the ground and having to bear the
brunt of defending it in all cases of intrusion, had a difficult
position, and may have made some enemies. At any rate, this
controversy was one of the means of stirring up animosities in the
neighborhood; and an account of it has been deemed necessary, as
contributing to indicate the elements of the awful convulsions which
soon afterwards desolated Salem Village.</p>

<p>When we reach the story, for which this account of the farms of the
village and the population that grew up on them is a preparative, we
shall come back to the Townsend-Bishop grant, and to the house, still
standing, that he built and dwelt in, upon it. It may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[i.97]</a></span> well to
pause, and view its interesting history prior to 1692. While occupied
by its original owner, the &quot;mansion,&quot; or &quot;cottage,&quot; was the scene of
social intercourse among the choicest spirits of the earliest age of
New England. Here Bishop, and, after him, Chickering, entertained
their friends. Here the fine family of Richard Ingersoll was brought
up. Here Governor Endicott projected plans for opening the country;
and the road that passes its entrance-gate was laid out by him. To
this same house, young John Endicott brought his youthful Boston
bride. Here she came again, fifteen years afterwards, as the bride of
the learned and distinguished James Allen, to show him the farm which,
received as a &quot;marriage gift&quot; from her former husband, she had brought
as a &quot;marriage gift&quot; to him. Here the same Allen, in less than six
years afterwards, brought still another bride. In all these various,
and some of them rather rapid, changes, it was, no doubt, often the
resort of distinguished guests, and the place of meeting of many
pleasant companies. During the protracted years of litigation for its
possession, frequent consultations were held within it; and now, for
twelve years, it had been the home of a happy, harmonious, and
prosperous family, exemplifying the industry, energy, and enterprise
of a New England household. A new chapter was destined, as we shall
see, to be opened in its singular and diversified history. But we must
return to the enumeration of the original landholders of the village.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[i.98]</a></span></p>

<p>George Corwin came to Salem in 1638. He had large tracts of land in
various places. He lived, a part of his time, on his farm in the
village; is found to have taken an active part in the proceedings of
the people, particularly in military affairs; and was captain of a
company of cavalry. His great mercantile transactions probably led him
to have his residence mostly in the town, first on a lot on Washington
Street, near the corner of Norman Street, where his grandson the
sheriff lived in 1692. In 1660, he bought of Ann, the relict of
Nicholas Woodbury, a lot on Essex Street, next east of the Browne
Block, with a front of about one hundred and fifty feet. Here he built
a fine mansion, in which he lived the remainder of his days. He died
Jan. 6, 1685, leaving an estate inventoried at &#163;5,964. 10<i>s.</i>
7<i>d.</i>,&#8212;a large fortune for those times. His portrait is preserved by
his descendants, one of whom, the late George A. Ward, describes his
dress as represented in the picture: &quot;A wrought flowing neckcloth, a
sash covered with lace, a coat with short cuffs and reaching half-way
between the wrist and elbow; the skirts in plaits below; an octagon
ring and cane.&quot; The last two articles are still preserved. His
inventory mentions &quot;a silver-laced cloth coat, a velvet ditto, a satin
waistcoat embroidered with gold, a trooping scarf and silver hat-band,
golden-topped and embroidered, and a silver-headed cane.&quot; His farms in
the vicinity contained fifteen hundred acres. His connections were
distinguished, and his descendants have included many eminent persons.
The name, by male<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[i.99]</a></span> descent, disappeared for a time in this part of the
country; but in the last generation it was restored in the female
descent by an act of the Legislature, and is honorably borne by one of
our most respectable families, who inherit his blood, and cherish the
memorials which time has spared of their first American ancestor.</p>

<p>William Hathorne appears on the church records as early as 1636. He
died in June, 1681, seventy-four years of age. No one in our annals
fills a larger space. As soldier commanding important and difficult
expeditions, as counsel in cases before the courts, as judge on the
bench, and in innumerable other positions requiring talent and
intelligence, he was constantly called to serve the public. He was
distinguished as a public speaker, and is the only person, I believe,
of that period, whose reputation as an orator has come down to us. He
was an Assistant, that is, in the upper branch of the Legislature,
seventeen years. He was a deputy twenty years. When the deputies, who
before sat with the assistants, were separated into a distinct body,
and the House of Representatives thus came into existence, in 1644,
Hathorne was their first Speaker. He occupied the chair, with
intermediate services on the floor from time to time, until raised to
the other House. He was an inhabitant of Salem Village, having his
farm there, and a dwelling-house, in which he resided when his
legislative, military, and other official duties permitted. His son
John, who succeeded him in all his public honors, also lived on his
own farm in the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[i.100]</a></span> a great part of the time. The name is
indelibly stamped on the hills and meadows of the region, as it was in
the civil history of that age, and has been in the elegant literature
of the present.</p>

<p>William Trask was one of what are called the &quot;First Planters.&quot; He came
over before Endicott, had his residence on Salem Farms, was a most
energetic, enterprising, and useful citizen, and filled a great
variety of public stations. He brought large tracts of land under
culture, planted orchards, and established mills at the head of
tide-water on the North River. He was the military leader of the first
age of the plantations in this neighborhood, was captain of the
train-band from the beginning, and, by his gallantry and energy in
action, commanded the applause of his contemporaries. For his services
in the Pequot Expedition, the General Court gave him and his
associates large grants of land. His obsequies were celebrated, on the
16th of May, 1666, with great military parade; and the people of the
town and the whole surrounding country followed his honored remains to
the grave.</p>

<p>Richard Davenport came to Salem in 1631. His first residence was in
the town; but soon he was led to the Farms. In 1636, he received a
grant of eighty acres; in 1638, of two hundred and twenty acres; and,
in 1642, eighty acres more, to be divided between him and Captain
Lothrop. Besides these, he received several smaller grants of meadow
and salt marsh. Such grants were made only with the view of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[i.101]</a></span>
them duly improved; and it cannot be doubted that he was zealously
engaged in agricultural operations. His town residence was on a lot
reaching from Essex Street to the North River. Its front extended from
the grounds now the site of the North Church to North Street. His
house stood at some distance back from Essex Street. This estate was
sold by his administrators, in 1674, to Jonathan Corwin, whose family
occupied it until a very recent period. He left the town in 1643, and
subsequently lived in what was afterwards Salem Village, until the
public service called him away. He sold some of his estates, but
retained others, on the Farms and in the town, to the time of his
death. He continued the superintendence of his country estate, which
seems to have been his family home, to the last. His military career
gave him early distinction, and closed only with his life. In 1634,
the General Court chose him &quot;Ensign to Capt. Trask.&quot; He was concerned
with Endicott in cutting out the cross from the king's colors. The
following is from the record of a meeting of the court, Nov. 7, 1634:
&quot;It is ordered that Ensign Davenport shall be sent for by warrant,
with command to bring his colors with him to the next court, as also
any other that hath defaced the said colors.&quot; Davenport did not seem
anxious to cover up his agency in this matter; for, when he offered
his next child to baptism, he signified to the assembly that he was
determined to commemorate and perpetuate the memory of the
transaction, by having her christened &quot;True<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[i.102]</a></span> Cross.&quot; It was necessary
to make a show of punishing Endicott and Davenport on this occasion,
to prevent trouble from the home government. Soon after, we find the
General Court heaping honors upon Davenport, and finally, in 1639,
making him a grant of one hundred and fifty acres of land, specially
noticing his services in the Pequot War, which appear to have elicited
general applause. In some desperate encounters with the savages,
seventeen arrows were shot &quot;into his coat of mail,&quot; and he was wounded
in unprotected parts of his person. He was twice deputy to the General
Court. In 1644, the General Court organized an elaborate system of
external defence, the whole based upon Castle Island, now Fort
Independence, in Boston Harbor. From that point, hostile invasion by a
naval force was to be repelled. Every vessel, on entering, was to
report to the castle, be examined and subject to the orders of the
commandant. It became the military headquarters of the colony, the
protection and oversight of whose commerce were intrusted to the
officer in command. This was the highest military station and trust in
the gift of the Government. It was assigned to Richard Davenport; and
he held it for twenty-one years, to the moment of his death. The
country reposed in confidence upon his watchful fidelity. He put and
kept the castle in an efficient condition. In 1659, as evidence of
their satisfaction and approval of his official conduct, the General
Court made him a grant of five hundred acres of land laid out in
Lancaster. On the 15th of July, 1665, he was killed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[i.103]</a></span> lightning, at
his post. The records of the General Court speak of &quot;the solemn stroke
of thunder that took away Captain Davenport.&quot; The whole country
mourned the loss of the veteran soldier; and the Court granted his
family an additional tract of one hundred acres of land on the
Merrimac River. He was in his sixtieth year at the time of his death.
Of the company required to be raised in Salem for the Block-Island
Expedition, in 1636, the three commissioned officers were furnished
from the Farms,&#8212;Trask, Davenport, and Read. They were soldiers by
nature and instinct, and to the end. The volleys of devoted, faithful,
and mourning comrades were fired over their graves, with no great
interval of time. United in early service, separated by the course of
their lives, they were united again in death.</p>

<p>Thomas Lothrop originally lived in the town, between Collins Cove and
the North River. He became a member of the First Church in Salem, and
was admitted a freeman in 1634. He soon removed to the Farms; and his
name appears among the rate-payers at the formation of the village
parish. For many years he was deputy from Salem to the General Court;
and after Beverly was set off, as his residence at the time was on
that side of the line, he was always in the General Court, as deputy
from the new town, when his other public employments permitted. No man
was ever more identified with the history of the Salem Farms. He
contributed to form the structure of its society, and the character of
its population, by all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[i.104]</a></span> a wise and good man could do. During his
whole life in America, he was more or less engaged in the military
service, in arduous, difficult, and dangerous positions and
operations; acting sometimes against Indians, and sometimes against
the French, or, as was usually the case, against them both combined.
He was occasionally sent to distant posts; commanding expeditions to
the eastward as far as Acadia. He was at one time in charge of a force
at Port Royal, now Annapolis, Nova Scotia. Increase Mather calls him a
&quot;godly and courageous commander.&quot; When the last decisive struggle with
King Philip was approaching, and aid was needed from the eastern part
of the colony to rescue the settlements on the Connecticut River from
utter destruction, the &quot;Flower of Essex&quot; was summoned to the field. It
was a choice body of efficient men, &quot;all culled out of the towns
belonging to this county,&quot; numbering about one hundred men. Lothrop,
of course, was their captain. In August, 1675, they were on the ground
at Hadley, the place of rendezvous. On the 26th of that month, Captain
Lothrop, with his company, and Captain Beers, of Watertown, with his,
after a vigorous pursuit, attacked the Indians in a swamp, about ten
miles from Hatfield, at the foot of Sugar-Loaf Hill. Ten were killed
on the side of the English, and twenty-six on the side of the Indians,
who were driven from the swamp, and scattered in their flight; to
fall, as was their custom, upon detached settlements; and continuing
to waste and destroy, by fire and sword, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[i.105]</a></span> hatchet,
scalping-knife, torch, and gun. On the 18th of September, Lothrop,
with his company, started from Deerfield, to convoy a train of
eighteen wagons, loaded with grain, and furniture of the inhabitants
seeking refuge from danger, with teamsters and others. Moseley, with
his men, remained behind, to scout the woods, and give notice of the
approach of Indians; but the stealthy savages succeeded in effecting a
complete surprise, and fell upon Lothrop as his wagons were crossing a
stream. They poured in a destructive fire from the woods, in all
directions. They were seven to one. A perfect carnage ensued. Lothrop
fell early in the unequal fight, and only seven or eight of his whole
party were left to tell the story of the fatal scene. The locality of
this disastrous and sanguinary tragedy has ever since been known as
&quot;Bloody Brook.&quot; In the list of those who perished by bullet, tomahawk,
or arrow, on that fearful morning, we read the names of many village
neighbors of the brave and lamented commander,&#8212;Thomas Bayley, Edward
Trask, Josiah Dodge, Peter Woodbury, Joseph Balch, Thomas Buckley,
Joseph King, Robert Wilson, and James Tufts. One of Lothrop's
sergeants, who was among the slain, Thomas Smith, then of Newbury,
originated in the village. His family had grants of land, including
the hill called by their name.</p>

<p>Captain Lothrop was as remarkable for the benevolence of his spirit
and the tenderness of his nature as for his wisdom in council, energy
in command, or gallantry in battle. Indeed, his character in private
life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[i.106]</a></span> was so beautiful and lovable, that I cannot refrain from leading
you into the recesses of his domestic circle. It presents a picture of
rare attractiveness. He had no children. His wife was a kind and
amiable person. They longed for objects upon which to gratify the
yearnings of their affectionate hearts. He had a large estate. His
character became known to the neighbors and the country people around.
If there was an occurrence calling for commiseration anywhere in the
vicinity, it was managed to bring it to his notice. Orphan children
were received into his household, and brought up with parental care
and tenderness. Many were, in this way, the objects of his charity and
affections. Persons especially, who were in any degree connected with
his wife's family, naturally conceived the desire to have him adopt
their children. This was the case particularly with those who were in
straitened circumstances. Others, knowing his disposition, would bring
tales of distress and destitution to his ears. Some, perhaps, turned
out to be unworthy of his goodness. In one instance, at least, where
he had taken a child into his family in its infancy, touched by
appeals made to his compassion by the parents, brought it up
carefully, watched over its education, and become attached to it, when
it had reached an age to be serviceable, the parents claimed and
insisted on their right to it, and took it away, much against his
will. But the good man's benevolence was not impaired, nor the stream
of his affectionate charities checked, by the misconduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[i.107]</a></span> or
ingratitude of his wards or of their friends. His plan was to do all
the good in his power to the children thus brought into his family, to
prepare them for usefulness, and start them favorably in life. In the
case of boys, he would get them apprenticed to worthy people in useful
callings. At the time of his death, there were two grown-up members of
his family, who appear to have been foisted upon his care in their
earliest childhood. But there was no blame to be attached to them in
the premises; and they were regarded by him with much affection. There
were no relations of his own in this country in need of charitable aid
or without adequate parental protection; and it was not strange that
several of his wife's connections should have availed themselves of
the benefit of his generous disposition. She herself gives a very
interesting account of an instance of this sort, in a deposition found
wrapped up among some old papers in the county court-house. The object
of the statement was to explain how a connection of hers became
domesticated in the family.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;When the child's mother was dead, my husband being with me
at my cousin's burial, and seeing our friends in so sad a
condition, the poor babe having lost its mother, and the
woman that nursed it being fallen sick, I then did say to
some of my friends, that, if my husband would give me leave,
I could be very willing to take my cousin's little one for a
while, till he could better dispose of it; whereupon the
child's father did move it to my husband. My dear husband,
considering my weakness, and the incumbrance I had in the
family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[i.108]</a></span> was pleased to return this answer,&#8212;that he did not
see how it was possible for his wife to undergo such a
burden. The next day there came a friend to our house, a
woman which gave suck, and she understanding how the poor
babe was left, being intreated, was willing to take it to
nurse, and forthwith it was brought to her: but it had not
been with her three weeks before it pleased the Lord to
visit that nurse with sickness also; and the nurse's mother
came to me desiring I would take the child from her
daughter, and then my dear husband, observing the providence
of God, was freely willing to receive her into his house.&quot;</p></div>

<p>At the time when this addition was made to his family, there was
certainly already in it another of his wife's connections, who had
been brought there when an infant in a manner perhaps equally
singular, and who had grown up to maturity. The particular
&quot;incumbrance,&quot; however, spoken of by her, related to another matter.
She was an only daughter. Her father had died many years before, at
quite an advanced age. Her mother, who was sickly and infirm as well
as aged, was taken immediately into her family, and remained under her
roof until her death. In her weak and helpless condition, much care
and exertion were thrown upon her daughter. The only objection the
captain seemed to have to increasing the burden of the household, by
receiving into it this additional child with its nurse, resulted from
conjugal tenderness and considerateness. It must be confessed that
there are some indications of well-arranged management in the
foregoing account. The friend who happened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[i.109]</a></span> call at the house the
&quot;next day,&quot; and who was able to supply what the &quot;poor babe&quot; needed,
certainly came very opportunely; and there was altogether a remarkable
concurrence and sequence of circumstances. But all that he saw was a
case of suffering, helpless innocence, and an opportunity for
benevolence and charity; and in these, with a true theology, he read
&quot;a providence of God.&quot; That child continued, to the hour when he took
his last farewell of his family, beneath his roof, and was an object
of affectionate care, and in her amiable qualities a source of
happiness to him and his good wife. It is stated that the children,
thus from time to time domesticated in the family, called him father,
and that he addressed them as his children. While they were infants,
he was &quot;a tender nursing father&quot; to them. When fondling them in his
arms, in the presence of his wife, he would solemnly take notice of
the providence of God that had &quot;disposed of them from one place to
another&quot; until they had been brought to him; and &quot;would present them
in his desires to God, and implore a blessing upon them.&quot;</p>

<p>The picture presented in the foregoing details is worth rescuing from
oblivion. Such instances of actual life, exhibited in the most private
spheres, constitute a branch of history more valuable, in some
respects, than the public acts of official dignitaries. History has
been too exclusively confined, in its materials, to the movements of
states and of armies. It ought to paint the portraits of individual
men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[i.110]</a></span> women in their common lives; it ought to lead us into the
interior of society, and introduce us to the family circles and home
experiences of the past. It cannot but do us good to know Thomas
Lothrop, not only as an early counsellor among the legislators of the
colony, and as having immortalized by his blood a memorable field of
battle and slaughter, but as the centre of a happy and virtuous
household on a New England farm. He made that home happy by his
benignant virtue. Although denied the blessing of children of his own,
his fireside was enlivened with the prattle and gayeties of the young.
Joy and hope and growth were within his walls. He was not a parent;
but his heart was kept warm with parental affections. He had a home
where dear ones waited for him, and rushed out to meet and cling round
him with loving arms, and welcome him with merry voices, when he
returned from the sessions of the General Court, or from campaigns
against the French and Indians.</p>

<p>Besides these offices of beneficence in the domestic sphere, we find
traces, in the local records, of constant usefulness and kindness
among his rural neighbors. He was called, on all occasions, to advise
and assist. As a judicious friend, he was relied upon and sought at
the bedside of the sick and dying, and in families bereaved of their
head. His name appears as a witness to wills, appraiser of estates,
trustee and guardian of the young. He was the friend of all. I know
not where to find a more perfect union of the hero and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[i.111]</a></span> the Christian;
of all that is manly and chivalrous with all that is tender,
benevolent, and devout.</p>

<p>Somewhere about the year 1650, after he had been married a
considerable time, he revisited his native country. A sister, Ellen,
had, in the mean while, grown up from early childhood; and he found
her all that a fond brother could have hoped for. With much
persuasion, he besought his mother to allow her to return with him to
America. He stated that he had no children; that he would be a father
to her, and watch over and care for her as for his own child. At
length the mother yielded, and committed her daughter to his custody,
not without great reluctance, trusting to his fraternal affection and
plighted promise. He brought her over with him to his American home.
She was worthy of his love, and he was true to his sacred and precious
trust.</p>

<p>Ellen Lothrop became the wife of Ezekiel Cheever, the great
schoolmaster; and I should consider myself false to all good learning,
if I allowed the name of this famous old man to slip by, without
pausing to pay homage to it. His record, as a teacher of a Latin
Grammar School, is unrivalled. Twelve years at New Haven, eleven at
Ipswich, nine at Charlestown, and more than thirty-eight at
Boston,&#8212;more than seventy in all,&#8212;may it not be safely said that he
was one of the very greatest benefactors of America? With Elijah
Corlett, who taught a similar school at Cambridge for more than forty
years, he bridged over the wide chasm between the education brought
with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[i.112]</a></span> by the fathers from the old country, and the education that
was reared in the new. They fed and kept alive the lamp of learning
through the dark age of our history. All the scholars raised here were
trained by them. One of Cotton Mather's most characteristic
productions is the tribute to his venerated master. It flows from a
heart warm with gratitude. &quot;Although he had usefully spent his life
among children, yet he was not become twice a child,&quot; but held his
faculties to the last. &quot;In this great work of bringing our sons to be
men, he was my master seven and thirty years ago, was master to my
betters no less than seventy years ago; so long ago, that I must even
mention my father's tutor for one of them. He was a Christian of the
old fashion,&#8212;an old New England Christian; and I may tell you, that
was as venerable a sight, as the world, since the days of primitive
Christianity, has ever looked upon. He lived, as a master, the term
which has been, for above three thousand years, assigned for the life
of a man.&quot; Mather celebrated his praises in a poetical effusion:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;He lived, and to vast age no illness knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Time's scythe, waiting for him, rusty grew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lived and wrought; his labors were immense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ne'er declined to preterperfect tense.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">*       *      *       *       *</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis Corlett's pains, and Cheever's, we must own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou, New England, art not Scythia grown.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To our early schoolmasters, as Mather says, and the later too, I may
add, it is owing, that the whole country did not become another
Scythia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[i.113]</a></span></p>

<p>Ezekiel Cheever was in this country as early as 1637. He was then in
New Haven, sharing in the work of the first settlement of that colony,
teaching school as his ordinary employment, but sometimes preaching,
and in other ways helping to lay the foundations of church and
commonwealth. While there, he had a family of several children. The
first-born, Samuel, became the minister of Marblehead. In 1650, he was
keeping a school at Ipswich. About this time, he lost his wife. On the
18th of November, 1652, he married Ellen, the sister whom Captain
Lothrop had brought with him from England. They had several children;
one of them, Thomas, was ordained first at Malden, and afterwards at
Chelsea. The old schoolmaster died on the 21st of August, 1708, aged
ninety-three years and seven months. His son Thomas reached the same
age. Samuel, the minister at Marblehead, was eighty-five years old at
his death. The name of Ezekiel, jr., appears on the rate-list of the
village parish as late as 1731, so that he must have reached the age
of at least seventy-seven years.</p>

<p>The antiquarians have been sorely perplexed in determining the
relationship of the Cheevers and Reas, as they appear to be connected
together as heirs of the Lothrop property, in an order of the General
Court of the 11th of June, 1681.</p>

<p>The facts are these: Captain Lothrop married Bethia, daughter of
Daniel Rea. He died without issue, and had made no will. As he was
killed in battle, his widow undertook to set up a nuncupative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[i.114]</a></span> will. A
snow-storm, on the day appointed to act upon the matter, so blocked up
the roads, that neither Ezekiel Cheever nor his son Thomas, who had
charge of his mother's rights, could get to Salem; and the court
granted administration to the widow. The Cheevers demanded a
rehearing: it was granted; and quite an interesting and pertinacious
law-suit arose, which was finally carried up to the General Court, who
decided it in 1681. The widow does not appear to have been actuated by
merely selfish motives, but sought to divert a portion of the landed
estate from the only legal heir, Ellen, the wife of Ezekiel Cheever,
to other parties, in favor of whom her feelings were much enlisted.
There is no indication of any unfriendliness between her and her
&quot;sister Cheever.&quot;</p>

<p>Lothrop's wife had become much attached to one of her connections, who
had been brought into the family. Her husband, having been fond of
children, had often expressed great affection for those of her
brother, Joshua Rea. He had also sometimes, in expressing his interest
in the Beverly Church, evinced a disposition to leave to it &quot;his ten
acre lot and his house upon the same,&quot; as a parsonage. Perhaps, if he
had not been suddenly called away, he might have done something,
particularly for the latter object. It appeared in evidence, from her
statements and from others, that he had been importuned to make a
will, and that it was much on his mind, particularly when recovering
from a long and dangerous sickness the winter before his death; but he
never could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[i.115]</a></span> brought to do it. There was no evidence that he had
ever absolutely determined on any thing positively or specifically.
His widow, who seems to have been a perfectly honest and truthful
woman, testified to a conversation that passed between them on the
subject, as they were riding &quot;together towards Wenham, the last
spring, in the week before the Court of election.&quot; In passing by
particular pieces of property owned by him, he indulged in some
speculations as to what disposal he should make of this or that
pasture or plain or woodland. But she did not represent that his
expressions were absolute and determinate, but rather indicative of
the then inclination of his mind. In another part of her statement,
she said, &quot;I did desire him to make his will, which, when he was sick,
I did more than once or twice; and his answer to me was, that he did
look upon it as that which was very requisite and fit should be done.
But, dear wife, thou hast no cause to be troubled; if I should die and
not make a will, it would be never the worse for thee; thyself would
have the more.&quot; It is not difficult to understand the case as it
probably stood in the mind of Captain Lothrop. Whenever the subject of
making a will, and doing kind things for the Beverly parish, and the
individuals in whose behalf his wife was so anxious, was brought up,
he felt the force, as he expressed it, &quot;of the duty which God required
of a master of a family to set his house in order;&quot; and he was no
doubt strongly moved, and sometimes almost resolved, to gratify her
wishes: but he remembered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[i.116]</a></span> solemn promise he had made to his
mother, as he parted from her for ever, and received his sister from
her hands, and every sentiment of honor, and of filial and fraternal
love, restrained him; and his mind settled into a conviction that it
was his duty to allow his sister the benefit of the final inheritance
of his property. As the particular persons to whom his wife wished him
to make bequests were her relatives, and the law would give her an
ample allowance in the use, for life, of his large landed property,
she would be able to provide for them after his death, as he had been
in the habit of doing.</p>

<p>The General Court took a just view of the case, and decided that she
should have the whole movable estate for her own &quot;use and dispose,&quot;
and the &quot;use and benefit&quot; for life of the houses and lands, &quot;making no
strip nor waste;&quot; after her death, the same to go to Ellen, the wife
of Ezekiel Cheever. The widow was to pay all debts due from the
estate, and also twenty pounds to the children of her brother, Joshua
Rea. The Court seemed to think, that, if any expectations had been
excited in that quarter, she was fully as responsible for it as her
late husband; and, as the Cheevers were to get nothing, while she
lived, out of the estate, the Court required her to pay the sum just
named to her nephews and nieces. They ordered Ezekiel Cheever to pay
five pounds as costs for their hearing the case, which he did on the
spot.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned, by the way, that the widow of Captain Lothrop was
married again within eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[i.117]</a></span> months of his death; but that was quite
usual in those days. She and her new husband concluded that it would
be troublesome to take care of Captain Lothrop's several farms. They
preferred to live in the town. She was probably over sixty years of
age. The conclusion of the whole matter was, that, in consideration of
sixty pounds paid down, they surrendered all claim whatever to the
&quot;houseing and lands&quot; left by Captain Lothrop, to Cheever and his wife.
They conveyed them &quot;free and clear of and from all debts owing from
the estate of said Lothrop, and gifts or bequests pretended to be made
by him, or by any ways or means to be had, claimed, or challenged
therefrom by any person or persons whomsoever.&quot; The relict of Captain
Lothrop died in 1688.</p>

<p>Ezekiel Cheever and his wife, having thus become possessed of all her
brother's real estate, conveyed the lands belonging to it in Salem
Village to their son, Ezekiel Cheever, Jr. He had, for some years,
been living in the town of Salem, carrying on the business of a
tailor. He was a member of the First Church, and appears to have been
a respectable person. His dwelling-house stood on the lot in
Washington Street occupied by the late Robert Brookhouse. He sold it
to the Rev. Nicholas Noyes, on the 14th of April, 1684, removed to the
village, took possession of the Lothrop farm, and was there in time to
bear a share in the witchcraft delusion.</p>

<p>In 1636, a grant of land was made to Thomas Gardner of one hundred
acres. He came to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[i.118]</a></span> country as early as 1624, and resided at Cape
Ann. Subsequently he removed to Salem, and, with his wife, was
admitted to the church. He was deputy to the General Court in 1637.
His grant was in the western part of the township, and embraced land
included within the limits of Salem Village. The name still remains on
the same territory. His sons became proprietors of several additional
tracts in the neighborhood. One of them, Joseph, is connected, in the
most conspicuous and interesting manner, with our military history.</p>

<p>The destruction of Captain Lothrop and his company, on the 18th of
September, filled the country with grief and consternation; and, as
the year 1675 drew towards a close, the conviction became general,
that the crisis of the fate of the colonies was near at hand. The
Indians were carrying all before them. Philip was spreading
conflagration, devastation, and slaughter around the borders, and
striking sudden and deadly blows into the heart of the country. It was
evident that he was consolidating the Indian power into irresistible
strength. Among papers on file in the State House is a letter
addressed to the governor and council, dated at Mendon, Oct. 1, 1675,
from Lieutenant Phinehas Upham, of Malden. In command of a company,
acting under Captain Gorham of Barnstable, who had also a company of
his own, he had been on a scout for Indians beyond Mendon, which was a
frontier town. Their route had been over a sweep of territory then an
almost un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[i.119]</a></span>broken wilderness, embracing the present sites of Grafton,
Worcester, Oxford, and Dudley. The result of the exploration is thus
given: &quot;Now, seeing that in all our marches we find no Indians, we
verily think that they are drawn together into great bodies far remote
from these parts.&quot; From other scouting parties, it became evident that
this opinion was correct, and that the Indians were collecting stores
and assembling their warriors somewhere, to fall upon the colonies at
the first opening of spring. Further information made it certain, that
their place of gathering was in the Narragansett country, in the
south-westerly part of the colony of Rhode Island. There was no
alternative but, as a last effort, to strike the enemy at that point,
with the utmost available force. A thousand men were raised, 527 by
Massachusetts, 315 by Connecticut, and 158 by Plymouth. Massachusetts
organized a company of cavalry and six companies of foot soldiers,
Connecticut five and Plymouth two companies of foot. All were placed
under the command of Governor Winslow, of Plymouth. The winter had set
in earlier than usual; much snow had fallen, and the weather was
extremely cold. The seven companies of Massachusetts, under the
command of Major Samuel Appleton of Ipswich, started on their march,
Dec. 10. On the evening of the 12th, having effected a junction with
the Plymouth companies, they reached the rendezvous, on the north side
of Wickford Hill, in North Kingston, R.I. On the 13th, Winslow
commenced his move upon the enemy. On the 18th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[i.120]</a></span> the Connecticut
troops joined him. His army was complete; the enemy was known to be
near, and all haste made to reach him. The snow was deep. The
Narragansetts were intrenched on a somewhat elevated piece of ground
of five or six acres in area, surrounded by a swamp, within the limits
of the present town of South Kingston. The Indian camp was strongly
fortified by a double row of palisades, about a rod apart, and also by
a thick hedge. There was but a single entrance known to our troops,
which could only be reached, one at a time, over a slanting log or
felled tree, slippery from frost and falling snow, about six feet
above a ditch. There were other passages, known only to the Indians,
by which they could steal out, a few at a time, and get a shot at our
people in the flank and rear. Many of our men were cut off in this
way. The allied forces had expected to pass the night, previous to
reaching the hostile camp, at a garrison about fifteen miles distant
from that point; but the Indians had destroyed the buildings, and
slaughtered the occupants, seventeen in number, two days before. Here
the troops passed the night, unsheltered from the bitter weather. The
next day, Dec. 19, was Sunday; but their provisions were exhausted,
and the supply they had expected to find had been destroyed with the
garrison-house. There could be no delay. They recommenced their march,
at half-past five o'clock in the morning, through the deep snow, which
continued falling all day, and reached the borders of what was
described, by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[i.121]</a></span> writer well acquainted with it, as &quot;a hideous swamp.&quot;
Fortunately, the early and long-continued extreme cold weather of that
winter had rendered it more passable than it otherwise would have
been. But the ground was rough, and very difficult to traverse. They
were chilled and worn by their long march, following winding paths
through thick woods, across gullies, and over hills and fields. It was
between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, and the short winter day
was wearing away. Winslow saw the position at a glance, and, by the
promptness of his decision, proved himself a great captain. He ordered
an instant assault. The Massachusetts troops were in the van; the
Plymouth, with the commander-in-chief, in the centre; the Connecticut,
in the rear. The Indians had erected a block-house near the entrance,
filled with sharp-shooters, who also lined the palisades. The men
rushed on, although it was into the jaws of death, under an unerring
fire. The block-house told them where the entrance was. The companies
of Moseley and Davenport led the way. Moseley succeeded in passing
through. Davenport fell beneath three fatal shots, just within the
entrance. Isaac Johnson, captain of the Roxbury company, was killed
while on the log. But death had no terrors to that army. The centre
and rear divisions pressed up to support the front and fill the gaps;
and all equally shared the glory of the hour. Enough survived the
terrible passage to bring the Indians to a hand-to-hand fight within
the fort. After a desperate struggle of nearly three hours, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[i.122]</a></span>
savages were driven from their stronghold; and, with the setting of
that sun, their power was broken. Philip's fortunes had received a
decided overthrow, and the colonies were saved. In all military
history, there is not a more daring exploit. Never, on any field, has
more heroic prowess been displayed. By the best computations, the
Indian loss was at least one thousand, including the large numbers who
perished from cold, as they scattered in their flight without shelter,
food, or place of refuge. Of the colonial force, over eighty were
killed, and one hundred and fifty wounded. Three of the Massachusetts
captains&#8212;Johnson, Gardner, and Davenport&#8212;were killed on the spot.
Three of the Connecticut captains&#8212;John Gallop, Samuel Marshall, and
Robert Seely&#8212;also fell in the fight. Captain William Bradford, of
Plymouth, was wounded by a musket-ball, which he carried in his body
to his grave. Captain John Gorham, also of the Plymouth colony, was
shortly after carried off by a fever, occasioned by the
over-exhaustion of the march and the battle. Lieutenant Phinehas
Upham, of Johnson's company, was mortally wounded. Great value appears
to have been attached to the services of this officer. In the hurried
preparation for the campaign, Captain Johnson had nominated his
brother as his lieutenant. The General Court overruled the
appointment. Johnson cheerfully acquiesced, and, in a paper addressed
to the Court, assured them that he &quot;most readily submitted to their
choice of Lieutenant Upham.&quot; This single passage is an imperishable
eulo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[i.123]</a></span>gium upon the characters of the two brave men who gave their
lives to the country on that fatal but glorious day.</p>

<p>Captain Gardner's company was raised in this neighborhood. Joseph
Peirce and Samuel Pikeworth of Salem, and Mark Bachelder of Wenham,
were killed before entering the fort. Abraham Switchell of Marblehead,
Joseph Soames of Cape Ann, and Robert Andrews of Topsfield, were
killed at the fort. Charles Knight, Thomas Flint, and Joseph Houlton,
Jr., of Salem Village; Nicholas Hakins and John Farrington, of Lynn;
Robert Cox, of Marblehead; Eben Baker and Joseph Abbot, of Andover;
Edward Harding, of Cape Ann; and Christopher Read, of Beverly,&#8212;were
wounded. An account of the death of Captain Gardner, in detail, has
been preserved. The famous warrior, and final conqueror of King
Philip, Benjamin Church, was in the fight as a volunteer, rendered
efficient service, and was wounded. His &quot;History of King Philip's War&quot;
is reprinted, by John Kimball Wiggin, as one of his series of elegant
editions of rare and valuable early colonial publications entitled
&quot;Library of New England History.&quot; In the second number, Part I. of
Church's history is edited by Henry Martyn Dexter. Church's account of
what came within his observation in this fight, with the notes of the
learned editor, is the most valuable source of information we have in
reference to it. He says, that, in the heat of the battle, he came
across Gardner, &quot;amidst the wigwams in the east end of the fort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[i.124]</a></span>
making towards him; but, on a sudden, while they were looking each
other in the face, Captain Gardner settled down.&quot; He instantly went to
him. The blood was running over his cheek. Church lifted up his cap,
calling him by name. &quot;Gardner looked up in his face, but spoke not a
word, being mortally shot through the head.&quot; The widow of Captain
Gardner (Ann, sister of Sir George Downing) became the successor of
Ann Dudley, the celebrated poetess of her day, by marrying Governor
Bradstreet, in 1680. She died in 1713.</p>

<p>There is a curious parallelism between the first and the last great
victory over the Indian power in the history of America. An interval
of one hundred and sixty one years separates them. On the 19th of
December, 1836,&#8212;the anniversary of the day when Winslow stormed the
Narragansett fort,&#8212;Colonel Taylor received his orders to pursue the
Florida Indians. It was a last attempt to subdue them. They had long
baffled and defied the whole power of the United States. Every general
in the army had laid down his laurels in inglorious and utter failure.
He started on the 20th, with an army of about one thousand men. On the
25th, he found himself on the edge of a swamp, impassable by artillery
or horses. On the opposite side were the Indian warriors, ready to
deal destruction, if he should attempt to cross the swamp. He had the
same question to decide which Winslow had; and he decided it in the
same way, with equal promptness. The struggle lasted about the same
time; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[i.125]</a></span> the loss, in proportion to the numbers engaged, was about
the same. The results were alike permanently decisive. Okee-cho-bee
stands by the side of Narragansett, and the names of Josiah Winslow
and Zachary Taylor are imperishably inscribed together on the tablets
of military glory.</p>

<p>Dr. Palfrey says that Captain Nathaniel Davenport was a son of
&quot;Davenport of the Pequot War.&quot; He was born in Salem, and brought up in
the village. His name, with those of his brave father, and his
associate in youth and in death Joseph Gardner, belongs to our local
annals. They were both the idols of their men. Davenport was dressed,
when he fell, in a &quot;full buff suit,&quot; and was probably thought by the
Indians to be the commander-in-chief. On receiving his triple wound,
he called his lieutenant, Edward Tyng, to him, gave him his gun in
charge, delivered over to him the command of his company, and died.</p>

<p>There has been some uncertainty on the point whether Nathaniel
Davenport was a son of Richard, the commandant at the castle. The fact
that he was associated with William Stoughton, and Stephen Minot whose
wife was a daughter of Richard Davenport, as an administrator of the
estate of the latter, has been regarded as rendering it probable. Dr.
Palfrey's unhesitating statement to that effect is, of itself, enough
to settle the question. There is, moreover, a document on file which
proves that he is correct. Nathaniel's widow had some difficulty in
settling his estate, and applied to the General Court for its
interposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[i.126]</a></span> Quite a mass of papers belong to the case. Among them
is a bill of expenses incurred by her in connection with his funeral
charges, such as, &quot;twenty-one rings to relatives,&quot; and to those &quot;who
took care to bring him off slain, eight pounds;&quot; and &quot;for mourning for
my mother Davenport, sisters Minot and Elliot, and myself, sixteen
pounds.&quot; This latter item is decisive, as we know that two of Richard
Davenport's daughters married persons of those names. It is a
circumstance of singular interest, as showing by how slight an
accident&#8212;for it is a mere accident&#8212;important questions of history
are sometimes determinable. This item, so far as I have been able to
find, is the only absolute evidence we have to the point that Richard
was the father of Nathaniel Davenport; and it would not have been in
existence, had not questions arisen in the settlement of the estate of
the latter requiring the action of the General Court. The record of
baptisms in the First Church at Salem, prior to 1636, is lost. The
names of Richard Davenport's children, baptized subsequent to that
date, are in the records of the Salem or Boston churches. As Nathaniel
is understood to have been one of the earliest born, the record of his
baptism was probably in the lost part of the Salem book.</p>

<p>It may be thought surprising, that so little appears to have been
known concerning an officer of his rank and parentage, and whose death
has rendered his name so memorable. To account for it, I must recur to
the history of the Narragansett expedition. No military organization
was ever more rapidly effected, or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[i.127]</a></span> thoroughly and promptly
executed its work. The commissioners of the three united colonies were
satisfied that the Indian rendezvous at Narragansett, where their
forces and stores were being collected and their resources
concentrated, must be struck at without a moment's delay; that the
blow must be swift and decisive; that it must be struck then, in the
depth of winter; that, if deferred to the spring, all would be lost;
that, if the Indian power was allowed to remain and to gather strength
until the next season, nothing could save the settlements from
destruction. Early in November, they formed their plan, and put the
machinery for summoning all their utmost resources into instant
action. On the 30th of November, the officers appointed for the
purpose made return, that they had impressed the required number in
the several counties and towns, fitted them out with arms, ammunition,
clothes, and all necessary equipments; that the men were on the
ground, ready to go forward. There was no time for recruiting, or
raising bounties, or substitute brokerage; no time for electioneering
to get commissions. The rank and file were ready: they had been
brought in by a process that gave no time for canvassing for offices.
A summons had been left at the house of every drafted man, to report
himself the next morning. If any one failed to appear, some other
member of the family, brother or father, had to take his place. The
organizing and officering of this force must be done instanter. All
depended upon suitable officers being selected. A company was wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[i.128]</a></span>ing
at Boston for a captain, and a captain must be found. Some one in
authority happened to think of Nathaniel Davenport. His childhood and
youth had been passed at Salem Village and on Castle Island: on
reaching maturity, he had removed to New York, and been there for
years in commercial pursuits. A short time before, he had returned to
Boston, and engaged in business there. His father had been dead since
1665, and not many persons knew him,&#8212;only, perhaps, a few of his
early associates, and the old friends of his father: but they knew,
that, from his birth to his manhood, he had breathed a military
atmosphere,&#8212;was a soldier, by inheritance, of the school of Lothrop,
Read, and Trask; and it was determined at once to hunt him up. He was
serving at Court; taken out of the jury-box in a pending trial; and
placed at the head of the company. The accurate historian of Boston,
Samuel G. Drake, says, &quot;Captain Davenport's men were extremely grieved
at the death of their leader; he having, by his courteous carriage,
much attached them to himself, although he was a stranger to most of
them when he was appointed their captain. On which occasion he made 'a
very civil speech,' and allowed them to choose their sergeants
themselves.&quot; He had no time to settle his accounts, arrange his
affairs, or confer with any one, but led his company at once to the
rendezvous. These circumstances, perhaps, partially explain why so
little seems to have been known of him in Boston, or to local
writers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[i.129]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides Captains Gardner and Davenport and the men whose names have
been mentioned as killed or wounded, there were in the Narragansett
fight the following from Salem Village and its farming neighborhood:
John Dodge, William Dodge, William Raymond, Thomas Raymond, John
Raymond, Joseph Herrick, Thomas Putnam, Jr., Thomas Abbey, Robert
Leach, and Peter Prescott. There may have been others: no full roll is
on record. The foregoing are gathered from partial returns
miscellaneously collected in the files at the State House. The Dodges
(sometimes the name is written Dodds, which appears, I think, to have
been its original form), and the Raymonds (sometimes written Rayment),
were, from the first, conspicuous in military affairs. A few words
explanatory of their relation to the village may be here properly
given.</p>

<p>On the 25th of January, 1635, the town of Salem voted to William
Trask, John Woodbury, Roger Conant, Peter Palfrey, and John Balch, a
tract of land, as follows: &quot;Two hundred acres apiece together lying,
being at the head of Bass River, one hundred and twenty-four poles in
breadth, and so running northerly to the river by the great pond side,
and so in breadth, making up the full quantity of a thousand acres.&quot;
These men were original settlers, having been in the country for some
time before Endicott's arrival. This circumstance gave to them and
others the distinguishing title of &quot;old planters.&quot; The grant of a
thousand acres, comprising the five farms above mentioned, was always
known as &quot;the Old Planters' Farms.&quot; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[i.130]</a></span> first proprietors of them,
and their immediate successors, appear to have arranged and managed
them in concert,&#8212;to have had homesteads near together between the
head of Bass River and the neighborhood of the &quot;horse bridge,&quot; where
the meeting-house of the Second Congregational Society of Beverly, or
of the &quot;Precinct of Salem and Beverly&quot; now stands. Their woodlands and
pasture lands were further to the north and east. An inspection of the
<a href="#map">map</a> will give an idea of the general locality of the &quot;Old Planters'
Farms&quot; in the aggregate&#8212;above the head of Bass River, extending
northerly towards &quot;the river,&quot; as the Ipswich River was called, and
easterly to the &quot;great pond,&quot; that is, Wenham Lake. Conant, Woodbury,
and Balch occupied their lands at once. I have stated how Trask's
portion of the grant went into the hands of Scruggs, and then of John
Raymond. Palfrey is thought never to have occupied his portion. He
sold it to William Dodge, the founder of the family of that name,
known by way of eminence as &quot;Farmer Dodge,&quot; whose wife was a daughter
of Conant. A portion of the grant assigned to Conant was sold by one
of his descendants to John Chipman, who, on the 28th of December,
1715, was ordained as the first minister of the &quot;Second Beverly
Society.&quot; He was the grandfather of Ward Chipman, Judge of the Supreme
Court, and for some time President, of the Province of New Brunswick,
and whose son of the same name was chief-justice of that court. He was
also grandfather of the wife of the great merchant, William Gray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[i.131]</a></span>
whose family has contributed such invaluable service to the
literature, legislation, judicial learning, and general welfare of the
country. The Rev. Mr. Chipman was the ancestor of many other
distinguished persons. The house in which he lived is still standing,
near the site of the church in which he preached. It is occupied by
his descendants, bearing his name, and, although much time-worn, has
the marks of having been a structure of a very superior order for that
day. The venerable mansion stands back from the road, on a smooth and
beautiful lawn, bordered by a solid stone wall of even lines and
surfaces. In these respects it well compares with any country
residence upon which taste, skill, and wealth have, in more recent
times, been bestowed.</p>

<p>The dividing line between Beverly and Salem Village, as seen on the
<a href="#map">map</a>, finally agreed upon in 1703, ran through the &quot;Old Planters'
Farms,&quot; particularly the portions belonging to the Dodges, Raymonds,
and Woodbury. It went through &quot;Captain John Dodge's dwelling-house,
six foot to the eastward of his brick chimney as it now stands.&quot; At
the time of the witchcraft delusion, the Raymonds and Dodges mostly
belonged to the Salem Village parish and church. They continued on the
rate-list, and connected with the proceedings entered on the
record-books, until the meeting-house at the &quot;horse bridge&quot; was opened
for worship, in 1715, when they transferred their relations to the
&quot;Precinct of Salem and Beverly.&quot;</p>

<p>When Sir William Phipps got up his expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[i.132]</a></span> against Quebec, in
1690, William Raymond raised a company from the neighborhood; and so
deep was the impression made upon the public mind by his ability and
courage, and so long did it remain in vivid remembrance, that, in
1735, the General Court granted a township of land, six miles square,
&quot;to Captain William Raymond, and the officers and soldiers&quot; under his
command, and &quot;to their heirs,&quot; for their distinguished services in the
&quot;Canada Expedition.&quot; The grant was laid out on the Merrimack, but,
being found within the bounds of New Hampshire, a tract of equivalent
value was substituted for it on the Saco River. Among the men who
served in this expedition was Eleazer, a son of Captain John Putnam,
who afterwards, for many years, was one of the deacons of the Salem
Village Church.</p>

<p>The short, rapid, sharp, and sanguinary campaign against the
Narragansetts seems to have tried to the utmost, not only the courage
and spirit of the men, but the powers of human endurance. The
constitutions of many were permanently impaired. As much fatigue and
suffering were crowded into that short month as the physical forces of
strong men could bear. We find such entries as this in the
town-books:&#8212;&quot;Salem, 1683. Samuel Beadle, who lost his health in the
Narragansett Expedition, is allowed to take the place of Mr. Stephens
as an innkeeper.&quot; A petition, dated in 1685, is among the papers in
the State House, signed by men from Lynn, the Village, Beverly,
Reading, and Hingham, praying for a grant of land, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[i.133]</a></span> their services
and sufferings in that expedition. The petition was granted. The
following extract from it tells the story: &quot;We think we have reason to
fear our days may be much shortened by our hard service in the war,
from the pains and aches of our bodies, that we feel in our bones and
sinews, and lameness thereby taking hold of us much, especially in the
spring and fall.&quot;</p>

<p>While there is &quot;reason to fear&quot; that the days of many were shortened,
there were some so tough as to survive the strain, and bid defiance to
aches and pains, and almost to time itself. In a list of fourteen who
went from Beverly, six, including Thomas Raymond and Lott, a
descendant of Roger Conant, were alive in 1735!</p>

<p>The grants of land made to these gallant men and their heirs amounted
in all, and ultimately, to seven distinct tracts, called &quot;Narragansett
Townships.&quot; They were made in fulfilment of an express public promise
to that effect. It is stated in an official document, that
&quot;proclamation was made to them, when mustered on Dedham Plain&quot; on the
9th of December, just as they took up their march, &quot;that, if they
played the man, took the fort, and drove the enemy out of the
Narragansett country, which was their great seat, they should have a
gratuity in land, besides their wages.&quot; The same document, which is in
the form of a message from the House of Representatives to the Council
of the Province of Massachusetts, dated Jan. 10, 1732, goes on to say,
&quot;And as the condition has been performed, certainly the promise, in
all equity and justice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[i.134]</a></span> ought to be fulfilled. And if we consider the
difficulties these brave men went through in storming the fort in the
depth of winter, and the pinching wants they afterwards underwent in
pursuing the Indians that escaped, through a hideous wilderness, known
throughout New England to this day by the name of the <i>hungry march</i>;
and if we further consider, that, until this brave though small army
thus played the man, the whole country was filled with distress and
fear, and we trembled in this capital, Boston itself; and that to the
goodness of God to this army we owe our fathers' and our own safety
and estates,&quot;&#8212;therefore they urge the full discharge of the
obligations of public justice and gratitude. They did not urge in
vain. The grants were made on a scale, that finally was liberal and
honorable to the government.</p>

<p>I have dwelt at this great length on the Narragansett campaign and
fight, partly because the details have not been kept as familiar to
the memory of the people as they deserve, but chiefly because they
demonstrate the military genius of the community with whose character
our subject requires us to be fully acquainted. The enthusiasm of the
troops, when Winslow gave the order for the assault, was so great,
that they rushed over the swamp with an eagerness that could not be
restrained, struggling as in a race to see who could first reach the
log that led into the fiery mouth of the fort. A Salem villager, John
Raymond, was the winner. He passed through, survived the ordeal, and
came unharmed out of the terrible fight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[i.135]</a></span> He was twenty-seven years of
age. He signed his name to a petition to the General Court, in 1685,
as having gone in the expedition from Salem Village, and as then
living there. Some years afterwards, he removed to Middleborough,
joined the church in that place in 1722, and died in 1725. The fact
that his last years were spent there has led to the supposition that
he went from Middleborough to the Narragansett fight; but no men were
drafted into that army from Middleborough. It was not a town at the
time, but was organized some years afterwards. It had no inhabitants
then. Philip had destroyed what few houses had been there, and
slaughtered or dispersed their occupants.</p>

<p>Thus far our attention has been directed to that portion of the
population of Salem Village drawn there by the original policy of the
company in London to attract persons of superior social position,
wealth, and education to take up tracts of land, and lead the way into
the interior. It operated to give a high character to the early
agriculture of the country, and facilitate the settling of the lands.
Without taking into view the means they had to make the necessary
outlays in constructing bridges and roads, and introducing costly
implements of husbandry and tasteful improvements, but looking solely
at the social, intellectual, and moral influence they exerted, it must
be acknowledged that the benefit derived from them was incalculable.
They gave a powerful impulse to the farming interest, and introduced a
high tone to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[i.136]</a></span> spirit of the community. They were early on the
ground, and remained more or less through the period of the first
generation. Their impress was long seen in the manners and character
of the people. There was surely a goodly proportion of such men among
the first settlers of this neighborhood.</p>

<p>I come now to another class drawn along with and after the
preceding,&#8212;the permanent, substantial yeomanry with no capital but
their sturdy industry, doing hard work with their strong arms, and
striking the roots of the settlement down deep into the soil by mixing
their own labor with it. A glance at the <a href="#map">map</a> will be useful, at this
point, showing the general direction by which the farming population
advanced to the interior. All between the North and Cow House Rivers
was, as now, called North Fields, and is still for the most part a
farming territory. All north of Cow House River, westwardly to Reading
and eastwardly to the sea, was originally known as the &quot;Farms&quot; or
&quot;Salem Farms.&quot; When the First Beverly Parish was set off in 1667, it
took from the &quot;Farms&quot; all east of Bass River. As Topsfield and other
townships were established, they were more or less encroached upon.
The &quot;Farmers&quot; as they were called, although unorganized, regarded
themselves as one community, having a common interest. The tide of
settlement flowed up the rivers and brooks, sought out the meadows,
and was drawn into the valleys among the hills.</p>

<p>John Porter, called &quot;Farmer Porter,&quot; came with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[i.137]</a></span> his sons from Hingham,
and bought up lands to the north of Duck or Crane River. His family
before long held among them more land, it is probable, than any other.
He served many years as deputy in the General Court, first from
Hingham and then from Salem. He is spoken of in the colonial records
of Massachusetts as &quot;of good repute for piety, integrity, and estate.&quot;
The Barneys, Leaches, and others went eastwardly towards Bass River.
The Putnams followed up Beaver Brook to Beaver Dam, and spread out
towards the north and west; while Richard Hutchinson turned southerly
to the interval between Whipple and Hathorne Hills, bought the
Stileman grant, and cleared the beautiful meadows where the old
village meeting-house afterwards stood. He was a vigorous and
intelligent agriculturist, and a man of character. He died in 1681, at
eighty years of age, leaving a large and well-improved estate. His
will has this item: I give &quot;five acres of land to Black Peter, my
servant.&quot; He had given fine farms to his children severally, many
years before his death. His second wife, who survived him, had no
children. He had come by her into possession of a valuable addition to
his estate. After distributing his property, and providing legacies
for children and grandchildren, his will left it to the option of his
widow to spend the residue of her days either in the family of his son
Joseph, or elsewhere; if she should prefer to live elsewhere, then she
should receive back, in her own right, all the property she had
originally owned; if she continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[i.138]</a></span> to live to her death in Joseph's
family, then her property was to go to him and his heirs. This, I
think, shows that he was as sagacious as he was just.</p>

<p>Richard Ingersoll came from Bedfordshire in England in 1629, bringing
letters of recommendation from Matthew Cradock to Governor Endicott.
After living awhile in town, a tract of land of eighty acres was
granted to him, on the east side of Wooleston River, opposite the site
of Danversport, at a place called, after him, Ingersoll's Point. He
there proceeded to clear and break ground, plant corn, fence in his
land, and make other improvements. He also carried on a fishery.
Subsequently he leased the Townsend Bishop farm, where he lived
several years. He died in 1644. Not long before his death, he
purchased, jointly with his son-in-law Haynes, the Weston grant. His
half of it he bequeathed to his son Nathaniel. He was evidently a man
of real dignity and worth, enjoying the friendship of the best men of
his day. Governor Endicott and Townsend Bishop were with him in his
last sickness, and witnesses to his will. His widow married John
Knight of Newbury. In a legal instrument filed among the papers
connected with a case of land title, dated twenty-seven years after
her first husband's death, she expresses in very striking language the
tender affection and respect with which she still cherished his
memory.</p>

<p>William Haynes married Sarah, daughter of Richard Ingersoll, and
occupied his half of the Weston grant. In company with his brother,
Richard Haynes, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[i.139]</a></span> had before bought of Townsend Bishop five hundred
and forty acres, covering a considerable part of the northern end of
the village territory. They sold one-third part of it to Abraham Page.
Page sold to Simon Bradstreet, and John Porter bought all the three
parts from the Hayneses and Bradstreet. It long constituted a portion
of the great landed property of the Porter family. These facts show
that William Haynes was a person of means; and the manner in which he
is uniformly spoken of proves that he was regarded with singular
respect and esteem. He died about 1650, and his son Thomas became
subsequently a leading man in the village.</p>

<p>There has been uncertainty where William Haynes came from, or to what
family of the name he belonged. Among the papers of the Ingersoll
family, it has recently been found that he is mentioned as &quot;brother to
Lieutenant-Governor Haynes.&quot; There seems to be no other person to whom
this language can refer than John Haynes, who, after being Governor of
Massachusetts, removed to Connecticut where he was governor and
deputy-governor, in alternate years, to the day of his death. John
Haynes, as Winthrop informs us, was a gentleman of &quot;great estate.&quot; His
property in England is stated to have yielded a thousand pounds per
annum. Dr. Palfrey says he was &quot;a man of family as well as fortune;
and the dignified and courteous manners, which testified to the care
bestowed on his early nurture, won popularity by their graciousness,
at the same time that they diffused a refining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[i.140]</a></span> influence by their
example.&quot; If William of the village was brother to John of
Connecticut, the fact that he and his brother Richard could make such
large purchases of lands, and the remarkable respect manifested
towards him, are well accounted for. The Ingersoll family traditions
and entries would seem to be the highest authority on such a point.</p>

<p>Job Swinnerton was a brother of John who for many years was the
principal physician in the town of Salem. He had several grants of
land, and was a worthy, peaceable, unobtrusive citizen. He seems to
have kept out of the heat of the various contentions that occurred in
the village; and, although his influence was sometimes decisively put
forth, he evidently did nothing to aggravate them. He died April 11,
1689, over eighty-eight years of age. He had a large family, and his
descendants continue the name in the village to this day. Daniel Rea
came originally to Plymouth, and in 1630 bought a dwelling-house,
garden, and &quot;all the privileges thereunto belonging,&quot; in that town. In
1632 he removed to Salem, and at once became a leading man in the
management of town affairs. He had a grant of one hundred and sixty
acres, which he occupied and cultivated till his death in 1662. He had
but two children: one, the wife of Captain Lothrop; the other, Joshua
Rea, became the founder of a large family who acted conspicuously in
the affairs of the village for several generations. Jacob Barney was
an original grantee, and for several years a deputy. His son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[i.141]</a></span> the
same name became a large landholder, and, on the 5th of April, 1692,
at the very moment when the witchcraft delusion was at its height,
gave two acres conveniently situated for the erection of a
schoolhouse. He conveyed it to inhabitants of the neighborhood to be
used for that purpose, mentioning them severally by name. I give the
list, as it shows who were the principal people thereabouts at the
time: &quot;Mr. Israel Porter; Sergeant John Leach; Cornet Nathaniel
Howard, Sr.; Corporal Joseph Herrick, Sr.; Benjamin Porter; Joshua
Rea, Sr.; Thomas Raymond, Sr.; Edward Bishop, <i>secundus</i>; John Trask,
Jr.; John Creesy; Joshua Rea, Jr.; John Rea; John Flint, Sr.&quot; Lawrence
Leach received a grant of one hundred acres; and others of the same
name and family had similar evidence that they were regarded as
valuable accessions to the population. William Dodge and Richard
Raymond had grants of sixty acres each; Humphrey and William Woodbury
had forty each. The families of Leach, Raymond, Dodge, and Woodbury,
still remain in the community of which their ancestors were the
founders. John Sibley had a grant of fifty acres. Robert Goodell was a
grantee, and became a large landholder.</p>

<p>The descendants of the two last-named persons are very numerous, and
have maintained the respectability of their family names. They are
each, at this day, represented by gentlemen whose enthusiastic
interest in our antiquities is proved by their invaluable labors and
acquisitions in the interesting depart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[i.142]</a></span>ments of genealogy and local
history,&#8212;John L. Sibley, Librarian of Harvard University; and Abner
C. Goodell, Register of Probate for the County of Essex.</p>

<p>Besides Townsend Bishop, there were two other persons of that name
among the original inhabitants of Salem. They do not appear to have
been related to him or to each other. Richard Bishop, whose wife
Dulcibell had died Aug. 6, 1658, married the widow Galt, July 22,
1660. He died Dec. 30, 1674.</p>

<p>Edward Bishop was in Salem in 1639, and became a member of the church
in 1645. In 1660 he was one of the constables of Salem, an original
member of the Beverly Church in 1667, and died in January, 1695. He
was an early settler on the Farms; his lands were on both sides of
Bass River, the parcels on the west side being above and below the
Ipswich road. His own residence was on the Beverly side; and he was
not usually connected with the concerns of the village. His name
appears but once in the witchcraft proceedings, and then in favor of
an accused person.</p>

<p>Edward Bishop, commonly called &quot;the sawyer,&quot; from the tenor of
conveyances of land, dates, and other evidences, appears to have been
a son of the preceding. In his earlier life, he was somewhat notable
for irregularities and aberrations of conduct. With his wife Hannah,
he was fined by the local court, in 1653, for depredating upon the
premises of his neighbors. During the subsequent period of his
history, he bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[i.143]</a></span> the character of an industrious and reputable
person. At some time previous to 1680, he married Bridget, widow of
Thomas Oliver. On the 9th of March, 1693, he married Elizabeth Cash.
He lived originally in Beverly; afterwards, at different times, on the
land belonging to his father in Salem Village,&#8212;the estate he occupied
being on both sides of the Ipswich road. His last years were passed in
the town of Salem. He died in 1705. His daughter Hannah, born in 1646,
became the wife of Captain William Raymond, one of the founders of the
numerous family of that name.</p>

<p>Edward Bishop, son of the preceding, called, for distinction,
&quot;husbandman,&quot; was born in 1648. He married Sarah, daughter of William
Wilds, of Ipswich. He was a respectable person, and lived in the
village on an estate also occupied by &quot;the sawyer.&quot; His house was west
of the avenue leading to Cherry Hill. In 1703 he removed to Rehoboth.</p>

<p>Edward Bishop, the eldest of his sons, married Susanna, daughter of
John Putnam, and in 1713 removed to that part of Ipswich now Hamilton.
Prior to 1695, these four Edward Bishops were all living; and the
youngest had a wife and children. All will be found connected with our
story, the second and third prominently. The fourth owed his safety,
perhaps, to the influential connections of his wife.</p>

<p>The first notice we have of Bray Wilkins is in the Massachusetts
colonial records, Sept. 6, 1638, when he was authorized to set up a
house and keep a ferry at Neponset River, and have &quot;a penny a person.&quot;
On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[i.144]</a></span> the 5th of November, 1639, the General Court accepted a report
made by William Hathorne and Richard Davenport, commissioners
appointed for the purpose, and, in accordance therewith, laid out a
farm for Richard Bellingham, who had been deputy-governor, was then an
assistant, and afterwards governor, &quot;on the head of Salem, to the
north-west of the town; there being in it a hill, and an Indian
plantation, and a pond.&quot; This nice little farm included seven hundred
acres, and &quot;about one hundred or one hundred and fifty acres of
meadow&quot; beside. The next thing we hear about the matter is a petition
to the General Court, May 22, 1661, of &quot;Bray Wilkins and John Gingle,
humbly desiring that the farm called by the name of Will's Hill, which
this Court granted to the worshipful Richard Bellingham, Esq., and
they purchased of him, may be laid to, and appointed to belong to,
Salem; being nigh its lands, and the petitioners of its society.&quot; The
Court granted the request. It seems that, about a year before, on the
9th of March, &quot;Bray Wilkins, husbandman, and John Gingle, tailor, both
of Lynn,&quot; had bought the Bellingham farm for two hundred and fifty
pounds, of which they paid at the time twenty-five pounds, and
mortgaged it back for the residue. The twenty-five pounds was paid as
follows: twenty-four pounds in a ton of bar-iron, and one pound in
money. Wilkins had, some time before, removed from Neponset, and
perhaps had been working in one of the iron-manufactories then in
operation at Lynn. When the balance of his wages over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[i.145]</a></span> expenses
enabled him, with the aid of Gingle, to raise a ton of iron and scrape
together twenty shillings, they entered upon their bold undertaking.
He had not a dollar in his pocket; but he had what was better than
dollars,&#8212;industrious habits, a resolute will, a strong constitution,
an iron frame, and six stout sons. After a while, he took into the
work, in addition to his own effective family force, two trusty
kinsmen, Aaron Way and William Ireland, conveying to them good farms
out of his seven hundred acres. He enlarged his farm, from time to
time, by new purchases, so as to more than make up for what he sold to
Way and Ireland. In 1676 the mortgage was fully discharged. He and his
sons bought out the heirs of Gingle, and the work was done. They held,
free from debt, in one tract, a territory about two miles in length on
the Reading line. Each member of the family had a house, barns,
orchards, gardens, meadows, upland, and woodland; and the homestead of
the old patriarch was in the midst of them, the enterprise of his
laborious life crowned with complete success. The innumerable family
of the name, scattered all over the country, has largely, if not
wholly, been derived from this source. Bray Wilkins, and the members
of his household in all its branches, were always on hand at parish
meetings in Salem Village. Over a distance, as their route must have
been, of five miles, they came, in all seasons and all weathers, by
the roughest roads, and, in the earlier period, where there were no
roads at all, through the woods, fording streams, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[i.146]</a></span> meeting on the
Lord's Day. He continued vigorous, hale, and active to the last; and
died, as he truly characterizes himself in his will, &quot;an ancient,&quot;
Jan. 1, 1702, at the age of ninety-two.</p>

<p>This was the way in which the large grants made to wealthy and eminent
persons, governors, deputy-governors, and assistants, came into the
possession and under the productive labor of a yeomanry who made good
their title to the soil by the force of their characters and the
strength of their muscles. One of the terms of Wilkins's purchase was,
that, if he found and wrought minerals on the land, he was to pay to
Bellingham or his heirs a royalty of ten pounds per annum. Believing
that the best mine to be found in land is the crops that can be raised
from it, he never tried to find any other.</p>

<p>Bray Wilkins will appear to have shared in the witchcraft delusion,
and been very unhappily connected with it; but he lived to behold its
termination, and to participate in the restoration of reason. The
minister of the parish at the time of his death, the Rev. Joseph
Green, kept a diary which has been preserved. He thus speaks of the
old man: &quot;He lived to a good old age, and saw his children's children,
and their children, and peace upon our little Israel.&quot;</p>

<p>It is rather curious to notice such indications as the mineral clause
in Wilkins's deed affords of the prevalent expectation, at the
beginning of settlements in this region, that valuable minerals would
be found in it. What makes it worthy of particular inquiry is, that
they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[i.147]</a></span> were found and wrought for some time, but that no one thinks of
looking after them now. Simon Bradstreet, Daniel Dennison, and John
Putnam put up and carried on together, upon a large scale, iron-works,
in 1674, at Rowley Village, now Boxford. Samuel and Nathan Leonard
were employed to construct them, and carried them on by contract.
These iron-works were long regarded as a promising enterprise and
valuable investment. The Leonards were probably of the same family
that, at Raynham and the neighborhood, engaged in this business to a
great extent, and for a long period, making it a source of wealth and
the foundation of eminent families. We know that the business was
carried on extensively in Lynn, and that Governor Endicott was quite
sure that he had found copper on his Orchard Farm. Who knows but that
modern science and more searching methods of detection may yet
discover the hidden treasures of which the fathers caught a glimpse,
and their enterprises be revived and conducted with permanent energy
and success?</p>

<p>In 1669, Joseph Houlton testified, that, when he was about twenty
years of age, in 1641, he was &quot;a servant to Richard Ingersoll,&quot; and
worked on his land at Ingersoll's Point. About the year 1652, he
married Sarah, daughter of Richard Ingersoll, and widow of William
Haynes. By her he had five sons and two daughters, who lived to
maturity. He gave to each of them a farm; and their houses were in his
near neighborhood. The sons were respectable and substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[i.148]</a></span>
citizens, and persons of just views and amiable sentiments. The father
was one of the honored heads of the village, and lived to a good old
age. He died May 30, 1705. From him, it is probable, all of the name
in this country have sprung. It will be for ever preserved in the
public annals and on the geographical face of the country. Samuel
Houlton, great-grandson of the original Joseph, was a representative
of Massachusetts for ten years in the old Congress of the
Confederation, for a time presiding over its deliberations. He was
also a member of the first Congress under the Constitution, and
subsequently, for a very long period, Judge of Probate for the county
of Essex. He was a true patriot and wise legislator; enjoyed to an
extraordinary degree the confidence and love of the people; had a
commanding person and a noble and venerable aspect; and was always
conspicuous by the dignity and courtesy of his manners. He was a
physician by profession; but his whole life was spent in the public
service. He was in both branches of the Legislature of the State, also
in the Executive Council. He was major of the Essex regiment at the
opening of the Revolution; was a member of the Committee of Safety,
and of every convention for the framing of the Government; and, for
more than thirty years, a judge of the Court of Common Pleas. He died,
where he was born and had his home for the greater part of his life,
in Salem Village, Jan. 2, 1816, in the seventy-eighth year of his age.</p>

<p>In 1724 a petition was presented to the Legislature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[i.149]</a></span> commencing as
follows: &quot;Whereas Salem is a most ancient town of Massachusetts
Province, and very much straitened for land,&quot; the petitioners pray for
a grant in the western part of the province. The petition was allowed
on condition that one lot be reserved for the first settled minister,
one for the ministry, and one for a school. Each grantee was required
to give a bond of twenty-five pounds to be on the spot; have a house
of seven feet stud and eighteen square at least, seven acres of
English hay ready to be mowed, and help to build a meeting-house and
settle a minister, within five years. A grandson of Joseph Houlton, of
the same name, led the company that emigrated to the assigned
location. The first result was the town of New Salem, in Franklin
County, incorporated in 1753; named in honor of the old town from
which their leading founder had come. But the people were not
satisfied with having merely a school. They must have an academy. They
went to work with a will, and an academy was established and
incorporated in 1795. This was the second result. The academy did not
flourish to an extent to suit their views, and they beset the
Legislature to grant them a township of land in the woods of Maine to
enable them to endow it. They carried their point, and in 1797
obtained the grant. The effort had been great, and great was the
rejoicing at its successful issue. But, as bad luck would have it,
just at that time land could not be sold at any price. The grant
became worthless; and deep and bitter was the disappointment of the
people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[i.150]</a></span> New Salem. The doom of the academy seemed to be settled,
and its days numbered and finished. But there were men in New Salem
who were determined that the academy should be saved. They met in
consultation, and, under the lead of still another Joseph Houlton, of
the same descent, fixed their purpose. They sold or mortgaged their
farms, which more than half a century of labor had rendered
productive, and which every association and every sentiment rendered
dear to them. With the money thus raised they bought the granted
tract, paying a good price for it. The preservation and endowment of
the academy were thus secured; but all benefit from it to themselves
or their descendants was wholly relinquished. It was the only way in
which the academy could be saved. Some must make the sacrifice, and
they made it. They packed up bag and baggage; sold off all they could
not carry; gathered their families together; bid farewell to the
scenes of their birth and childhood, the homes of their life, and the
fruits of their labor; and started in wagons and carts on the journey
to Boston. Their location was hundreds of miles distant, far down in
the eastern wilderness, and inaccessible from the extremes of
settlement at that time on the Penobscot. As the only alternative,
they embarked in a coasting-vessel; went down the Bay of Fundy to St.
John, N.B.; took a river-sloop up to Fredericton,&#8212;a hundred miles;
got up the river as they could, in barges or canoes, eighty miles
further to Woodstock; and there, turning to the left, struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[i.151]</a></span> into the
forest, until they reached their location. The third result of this
emigration, in successive generations and stages, from Salem Farms, is
to be seen to-day in a handsome and flourishing village, interspersed
and surrounded with well-cultivated fields,&#8212;the shire town of the
county of Aroostook, in the State of Maine; which bears the name of
the leader of this disinterested, self-sacrificing, and noble company.
Three times was it the lot of this one family to encounter and conquer
the difficulties, endure and triumph over the privations, and carry
through the herculean labors, of subduing a rugged wilderness, and
bringing it into the domain of civilization,&#8212;at Salem Village, New
Salem, and Houlton. It would be difficult to find, in all our history,
a story that more strikingly than this illustrates the elements of the
glory and strength of New England,&#8212;zeal for education,&#8212;enterprise
invigorated by difficulties,&#8212;and prowess equal to all emergencies.</p>

<p>John Burton came early to Salem by way of Barbadoes. He combined the
pursuits of a farmer and a tanner. He was a sturdy old Englishman,
who, while probably holding the theological sentiments that prevailed
in his day, abhorred the spirit of persecution, and was unwilling to
live where it was allowed to bear sway. He does not appear to have
been a Quaker, but sympathized with all who suffered wrong. In 1658,
he went off in their company to Rhode Island, sharing their
banishment. But his conscience would not let him rest in voluntary
flight. He came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[i.152]</a></span> back in 1661, to bear his testimony against
oppression. He was brought before the Court, as an abettor and
shelterer of Quakers. He told the justices that they were robbers and
destroyers of the widows and fatherless, that their priests divined
for money, and that their worship was not the worship of God. They
commanded him to keep silent. He commanded them to keep silent. They
thought it best to bring the colloquy to a close by ordering him to
the stocks. They finally concluded, upon the whole, to let him alone;
and he remained here the rest of his life. His descendants are through
a daughter (who married William Osborne) and his son Isaac. They are
numerous, under both names. Isaac was an active and respectable
citizen of the village, and a farmer of enterprise and energy. He
carried on, under a lease, Governor Endicott's farm of over five
hundred acres on Ipswich River, and had lands of his own. In
subsequent generations, this family branched off in various directions
to Connecticut, Vermont, and elsewhere. One detachment of them went to
Wilton, N.H., where the family still remains on the original
homestead. The late Warren Burton, who was born in Wilton,&#8212;a graduate
of Harvard College in the class of 1821, and well known for his
invaluable services in the cause of education, philanthropy, and
letters,&#8212;was a direct descendant of John Burton, and as true to the
rights of conscience as the old tanner, who bearded the lion of
persecution in the day of his utmost wrath, and in his very den.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[i.153]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry Herrick, who, as has been stated, purchased the Cherry-Hill farm
of Alford, was the fifth son of Sir William Herrick, of Beau Manor
Park, in the parish of Loughborough, in the county of Leicester,
England. He came first to Virginia, and then to Salem. He was
accompanied to America by another emigrant from Loughborough, named
Cleaveland. Herrick became a member of the First Church at Salem in
1629, and his wife Edith about the same time. Their fifth son, Joseph,
baptized Aug. 6, 1645, owned and occupied Cherry Hill in 1692. He
married Sarah, daughter of Richard Leach, Feb. 7, 1667. He was a man
of great firmness and dignity of character, and, in addition to the
care and management of his large farm, was engaged in foreign
commerce. As he bore the title of Governor, he had probably been at
some time in command of a military post or district, or perhaps of a
West-India colony. His descendants are numerous, and have occupied
distinguished stations, often exhibiting a transmitted military stamp.
Joseph Herrick was in the Narragansett fight. It illustrates the state
of things at that time, that this eminent citizen, a large landholder,
engaged in prosperous mercantile affairs, and who had been abroad,
was, in 1692, when forty-seven years of age, a corporal in the village
company. He was the acting constable of the place, and, as such,
concerned in the early proceedings connected with the witchcraft
prosecutions. For a while he was under the influence of the delusion;
but his strong and enlightened mind soon led him out of it. He was one
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[i.154]</a></span> the petitioners in behalf of an accused person, when intercession,
by any for any, was highly dangerous; and he was a leader in the party
that rose against the fanaticism, and vindicated the characters of its
victims. He inherited a repugnance to oppression, and sympathy for the
persecuted. His father and mother appear, by a record of Court, to
have been fined &quot;for aiding and comforting an excommunicated person,
contrary to order.&quot;</p>

<p>William Nichols, in 1651, bought two hundred acres, which had been
granted to Henry Bartholomew, partly in the village, but mostly beyond
the &quot;six-mile extent,&quot; and consequently set off to Topsfield. He had
several other lots of land. He distributed nearly all his real estate,
during his lifetime, to his son John; his adopted son, Isaac Burton;
his daughters, the wives of Thomas Wilkins and Thomas Cave; and his
grand-daughter, the wife of Humphrey Case. His only son John had
several sons, and from them the name has been widely dispersed. In a
deposition dated May 14, 1694, William Nichols declares himself &quot;aged
upwards of one hundred years.&quot; As his will was offered for Probate
Feb. 24, 1696, he must have been one hundred and two years of age at
his death.</p>

<p>William Cantlebury was a large landholder, having purchased
three-quarters of the Corwin grant. He died June 1, 1663. His name
died with him, as he had no male issue. His property went to his
daughters, who were represented, in 1692, under the names of Small,
Sibley, and Buxton. The Flints, Popes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[i.155]</a></span> Uptons, Princes, Phillipses,
Needhams, and Walcotts, had valuable farms, and appear, from the
records and documents, to have been respectable, energetic, and
intelligent people. Daniel Andrew was one of the strong men of the
village; had been a deputy to the General Court, and acted a prominent
part before and after the witchcraft convulsion. But the great family
of the village&#8212;greater in numbers and in aggregate wealth than any
other, and eminently conspicuous on both sides in the witchcraft
proceedings&#8212;remains to be mentioned.</p>

<p>John Putnam had a grant of one hundred acres, Jan. 20, 1641. With his
wife Priscilla, he came from Buckinghamshire, England, and was
probably about fifty years of age on his arrival in this country. He
was a man of great energy and industry, and acquired a large estate.
He died in 1662, leaving three sons,&#8212;Thomas, born in 1616; Nathaniel,
in 1620; and John, in 1628. For a more convenient classification, I
shall, in speaking of this family, refer, not to the original John at
all, but to the sons as its three heads.</p>

<p>Thomas, the eldest, inherited a double share of his father's lands. He
was of age when he came to America, and had received a good education.
He appears to have settled, in the first instance, in Lynn, where for
several years he acted as a magistrate, holding local courts, by
appointment of the General Court. Upon removing to Salem, he was
chosen, as the town-records show, to the office of constable. This was
considered at that time as quite a distinguished position, carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[i.156]</a></span>
with it a high authority, covering the whole executive local
administration. Thomas Putnam was the first clerk of Salem Village,
and acted prominently in military, ecclesiastical, and municipal
affairs. He seems to have been a person of a quieter temperament than
his younger brothers, and led a somewhat less stirring life.
Possessing a large property by inheritance, he was not quite so active
in increasing it; but, enjoying the society and friendship of the
leading men, lived a more retired life. At the same time, he was
always ready to serve the community if called for, as he often was,
when occasion arose for the aid of his superior intelligence and
personal influence. He married first, while in Lynn, Ann, daughter of
Edward Holyoke, great-grandfather of the President of Harvard College
of that name whose son, the venerable centenarian, Dr. Edward Augustus
Holyoke, is remembered as a true Christian philosopher by the
generation still lingering on the stage. Having lost his wife on the
1st of September, 1665, he married, on the 14th of November, 1666,
Mary, widow of Nathaniel Veren; coming, through her, into possession
of property in Jamaica and Barbadoes, in which places Veren had
resided, more or less, in the prosecution of commercial business. His
homestead, as shown on the <a href="#map">map</a>, was occupied by his widow in 1692,
and, after her death, by her son Joseph, the father of General Israel
Putnam. He had also a town residence on the north side of Essex
Street, extending back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[i.157]</a></span> the North River. Its front on Essex Street
embraced the western part of the grounds now occupied by the North
Church, and extended to a point beyond the head of Cambridge Street.
He left the eastern half of this property to his son Thomas, and the
western half to his son Joseph. To his son Edward he left another
estate in the town, on the western side of St. Peter's Street, to the
north of Federal Street.</p>

<p>Thomas Putnam died on the 5th of May, 1686. He left large estates in
the village to each of his children, and a valuable piece of meadow
land, of fifteen acres, to a faithful servant.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Putnam married Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Hutchinson,
and, besides what he received from his father, came, through his wife,
into possession of seventy-five acres. On that tract he built his
house and passed his life. The property has remained uninterruptedly
in his family. One of them, the late Judge Samuel Putnam, of the
Supreme Court of Massachusetts, enjoyed it as a country residence, and
it is still held by his children. Nathaniel Putnam was a deputy to the
General Court, and constantly connected with all the interests of the
community. He had great business activity and ability, and was a
person of extraordinary powers of mind, of great energy and skill in
the management of affairs, and of singular sagacity, acumen, and
quickness of perception. He died July 23, 1700, leaving a numerous
family and a large estate.</p>

<p>John Putnam had the same indefatigable activity as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[i.158]</a></span> Nathaniel. He was
often deputy to the General Court, and accumulated a very great landed
property. He married Rebecca Prince, step-daughter of John Gedney, and
died on the 7th of April, 1710. He was buried with military honors. He
left a large family of sons and daughters. We shall often meet him in
our narrative, and gather the materials, as we go along, to form an
opinion of his character. The earliest rate-list in the parish record
book is for 1681. At that time the three brothers were all living; the
aggregate sum assessed upon ninety-four names was two hundred pounds.
The rate of Thomas was &#163;10. 6<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; that of Nathaniel, &#163;9.
10<i>s.</i>; that of John, &#163;8. No other person paid as much as either of
them.</p>

<p>These brothers, as well as many others of the large landholders in the
village, adopted the practice of giving to their sons and sons-in-law,
outright, by deed, good farms, as soon as they became heads of
families; so that, as the fathers advanced in life, their own estates
were gradually diminished; and, when unable any longer to take an
active part in managing their lands, they divided up their whole
remaining real estate, making careful contracts with their children
for an adequate maintenance, to the extent of their personal wants and
comfort. Joseph Houlton did this: so did the widow Margery Scruggs,
old William Nichols, Francis Nurse, and many others. In his last
years, John Putnam was on the rate-list for five shillings only, while
all his sons and daughters were assessed severally in large sums. In
this way they had the satisfac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[i.159]</a></span>tion of making their children
independent, and of seeing them take their places among the heads of
the community.</p>

<p>Where this practice was followed, there were few quarrels in families
over the graves of parents, and controversies seldom arose about the
provisions of wills. In some cases no wills were needed to be made. It
is apparent, that, in many respects, this was a wise and good
practice. It was, moreover, a strictly just one. As the sons were
growing to an adult age, they added, by their labors, to the value of
lands,&#8212;inserted a property into them that was truly their own; and
their title was duly recognized. In a new country, land has but little
value in itself; the value is imparted by the labor that clears it and
prepares it to yield its products. In 1686, Nathaniel Putnam testified
that for more than forty years he had lived in the village, and that
in the early part of that time unimproved land brought only a shilling
an acre, while a cow was worth five pounds. In 1672, the rate of
taxation on unimproved land was a half penny per acre, and, for land
on which labor had been expended, a penny per acre. In 1685 it was
taxed at the rates of three shillings for a hundred acres of wild
land, and one penny an acre for &quot;land within fence.&quot; The relative
value of improved land constantly increased with the length of time it
had been under culture. It may be said that labor added two-thirds to
the value of land, and that he who by the sweat of his brow added
those two-thirds, to that extent owned the land. An industrious young
man went out into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[i.160]</a></span> father's woods, cut down the trees, cleared the
ground, fenced it in, and prepared it for cultivation. All that was
thus added to its value was his creation, and he its rightful owner.
The right was recognized, and full possession given him, by deed, as
soon as he had opened a farm, and built a house, and brought a wife
into it.</p>

<p>The effect of this was to anchor a family, from generation to
generation, fast to its ancestral acres. It strengthened the ties that
bound them to their native fields. Its moral effect was beyond
calculation. When a young man was thus enabled to start in life on an
independent footing, it made a man of him while he was young. It
invested him with the dignity of a citizen by making him feel his
share of responsibility for the security and welfare of society. It
gave scope for enterprise, and inspiration to industry, at home. It
led to early marriages, under circumstances that justified them.
Joseph Putnam, the youngest son of Thomas, at the age of twenty years
and seven months, took as his bride Elizabeth, daughter of Israel
Porter, and grand-daughter of William Hathorne, when she was sixteen
years and six months old. We shall see what a valuable citizen he
became; and she was worthy of him. A large and noble family of
children grew up to honor them, one of the youngest of whom was Israel
Putnam, of illustrious Revolutionary fame.</p>

<p>Though there were descendants of this family in every company of
emigrants that went forth from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[i.161]</a></span> Salem Village, in all directions, in
every generation, to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Maine, and
all parts of the New England, Middle, Western, and Pacific States,
there is about as large a proportionate representation of the name
within the precincts of Salem Village to-day, as there ever was. Fifty
Putnams are at present voters in Danvers, on a list of eight hundred
names,&#8212;one-sixteenth of the whole number. The rate-schedule of 1712
shows almost precisely the same proportion.</p>

<p>Edward Putnam, whom we shall meet again, was baptized July 4, 1654.
After serving as deacon of the church from its organization, a period
of forty years, he resigned on account of advancing age; and in 1733,
as he was entering on his eightieth year, gave this account of his
family: &quot;From the three brothers proceeded twelve males; from these
twelve males, forty males; and from these forty males, eighty-two
males: there were none of the name of Putnam in New England but those
from this family.&quot; With respect to their situation in life, he
remarks: &quot;I can say with the Psalmist, I have been young, and now am
old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor their seed
begging bread except of God, who provides for all. For God hath given
to the generation of my fathers a generous portion, neither poverty
nor riches.&quot; When the infirmities of age prevented his longer
partaking in the worship of the Lord's Day, this good old man
relinquished his residence near the church, and removed to his
original homestead, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[i.162]</a></span> the neighborhood of his children, which had
then been included in the new town of Middleton. His will is dated
March 11, 1731. It was offered in Probate, April 11, 1748. After
making every reasonable deduction, in view of his share of
responsibility for the earlier proceedings in the witchcraft
prosecutions, we may participate in the affection and veneration with
which this amiable and gentle-hearted man was regarded by his
contemporaries.</p>

<p>The provisions of his will contain items which so strikingly
illustrate his character, and give us such an insight of the domestic
life of the times, that a few of them will be presented. According to
the prevalent custom, he had given good farms to his several children
when they became heads of families. In his will, he distributes the
residue of his real estate among them with carefulness and an equal
hand, describing the metes and bounds of the various tracts with great
minuteness, so as to prevent all questions of controversy among them.
He gives legacies in money to his daughters, ten pounds each; and, to
his grand-daughters, five pounds each. To one of his five sons, he
gives his &quot;cross-cut saw.&quot; This was used to saw large logs crosswise,
having two handles worked by two persons, and distinguished from the
&quot;pit saw,&quot; which was used to saw logs lengthwise. All his other tools
were to be divided among his sons, to one of whom he also gives his
cane; to another, his &quot;Great Bible;&quot; to another, &quot;Mr. Jeremiah
Burroughs's Works;&quot; to another, &quot;Mr. Flavel's Works;&quot; and, to the
other, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[i.163]</a></span> &quot;girdle and sword.&quot; To one of them he gives his desk, and
&quot;that box wherein are so many writings;&quot; to another, his &quot;share in the
iron-works;&quot; and to another, his share &quot;in the great timber chain.&quot;
This, with other evidence, shows that there was a boom, and
arrangements on a large scale for the lumbering business, at that
time, on Ipswich River. The provisions for his wife were very
considerate, exact, and minute, so as to prevent all possibility of
there being any difficulty in reference to her rights, or of her ever
suffering want or neglect. He gives to her, absolutely and for her own
disposal, the residue of his books and all his &quot;movable estate&quot; in the
house and out of it, including all &quot;cattle, sheep, swine,&quot; the whole
stock of the homestead farm, agricultural implements, and carriages.
He makes it the duty of one of his sons to furnish her with all the
&quot;firewood&quot; she may want, with ten bushels of corn-meal, two bushels of
English meal, four bushels of ground malt, four barrels of good
cider,&#8212;he to find the barrels&#8212;as many apples &quot;as she shall see
cause,&quot; and nine or ten score weight of good pork, annually: he was to
&quot;keep for her two cows, winter and summer,&quot; and generally to provide
all &quot;things needful.&quot; The will specifies, apartment by apartment, from
cellar to garret, one-half of the house, to be for her accommodation,
use, and exclusive control, and half of the garden. The sons were to
pay, in specified proportions, all his funeral charges. One of the
sons was to pay her forthwith four pounds in money; and they were
severally to deliver to her annu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[i.164]</a></span>ally, in proportions expressly
stated, ten pounds for pocket money. When the relative value of money
at that time is considered, and the other particulars above named
taken into account, it will be allowed that he was faithful and wise
in caring for the wife of his youth and the companion of his long
life. There is no better criterion of the good sense and good feeling
of a person than his last will and testament. The result of a quite
extensive examination is a conviction that the application of this
test to the early inhabitants of Salem Village is most creditable to
them, particularly in the tender but judicious and effectual manner in
which the rights, comfort, independence, and security of their wives
were provided for.</p>

<p>In the third generation, the three Putnam families began to give their
sons to the general service of the country in conspicuous public
stations, and in the professional walks of life. Their names appear on
the page of history and in the catalogues of colleges. Major-General
Israel Putnam was a grandson of the first Thomas. On the 14th of May,
1718, Archelaus, a grandson of John, and son of James, died at
Cambridge, while an undergraduate. Benjamin, a son of Nathaniel, in
his will, presented for Probate, April 25, 1715, says, &quot;I give my son
Daniel one hundred and fifty pounds for his learning.&quot; Daniel lived
and died in the ministry, at North Reading. His name heads the list of
more than thirty&#8212;all, it is probable, of this family&#8212;in the last
Triennial Catalogue of Harvard University.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[i.165]</a></span></p>

<p>The brightest name in the annals of Salem Village, though frequently
referred to, has not yet been presented for your contemplation. I
shall hold it up and keep it in your view by a somewhat detailed
description, not only because it is necessary to a full understanding
of our subject, but because it is good to gaze upon a life of virtue;
to pause while beholding a portrait beaming with beneficence, and
radiant with all excellent, beautiful, and attractive affections.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Ingersoll was about eleven years old at the death of his
father. His mother married John Knights, of Newbury, who became the
head of her household, and continued to carry on the Townsend Bishop
farm for several years. Governor Endicott, the friend and neighbor of
Richard Ingersoll, took Nathaniel, while still a lad, into his family.
In a deposition made in Court, June 24, 1701, Nathaniel Ingersoll
says, &quot;I went to live with Governor Endicott as his servant four
years, on the Orchard Farm.&quot; At that time, the term &quot;servant&quot; had no
derogatory sense connected with it. It merely implied the relations
between an employer and the employed, without the least tint of the
feeling which we associate with the condition of servility. Here was a
youth, who, by his father's will, was the owner of a valuable estate
of seventy-five acres in the immediate neighborhood, voluntarily
seeking the privilege of entering the service of his father's friend,
because he thereby would be better qualified, when old enough, to
enter upon his own estate. Governor Endicott's political duties were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[i.166]</a></span>
not then regarded as requiring him to live in Boston; and his usual
residence was at the Orchard Farm, where he was making improvements
and conducting agricultural operations upon so large a scale that it
was the best school of instruction anywhere to be found for a young
person intending to make that his pursuit in life. Young John Putnam,
as has been stated, was there for the same purpose, under similar
circumstances.</p>

<p>Having built a house and barn, and provided the necessary stock and
materials, Nathaniel Ingersoll went upon his farm when about nineteen
years of age. Soon after, probably, he married Hannah Collins of Lynn,
who, during their long lives, proved a worthy helpmeet. His house was
on a larger scale than was usual at that time. One of its rooms is
spoken of as very large; and the uses to which his establishment was
put, from time to time, prove that it must have had capacious
apartments. Its site is shown on the <a href="#map">map</a>. The road from Salem to
Andover passed it, not at an angle as now, but by a curve. The present
parsonage of Danvers Centre stands on the lot. But Ingersoll's house
was a little in the rear of the site occupied by the present
parsonage. It faced south. In front was an open space, or lawn, called
Ingersoll's Common. Here he lived nearly seventy years. During that
long period, his doors were ever open to hospitality and benevolence.
His house was the centre of good neighborhood and of all movements for
the public welfare. His latch-string was always out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[i.167]</a></span> for friend or
stranger. In a military sense, and every other sense, it was the
head-quarters of the village. On his land, a few rods to the
north-east, stood the block-house where watch was kept against Indian
attacks. There a sentinel was posted day and night, under his
supervision. The spot was central to the several farming settlements;
and all meetings of every kind took place there. To accommodate the
public, he was licensed to keep a victualling-house; also to sell beer
and cider by the quart &quot;on the Lord's Day.&quot; This last provision was
for the benefit of those who came great distances to meeting, and had
to find refreshment somewhere between the services. To meet the
occasions arising out of this business, he probably had a separate
building. Indeed, the evidence, in the language used in reference to
it, is quite decisive that there was an &quot;ordinary,&quot; distinct from the
dwelling-house. The location was thought to render such an
establishment necessary, and his character secured its orderly
maintenance.</p>

<p>Travellers through the country stopped at &quot;Nathaniel Ingersoll's
corner.&quot; The earliest path or roadway to and from the eastern
settlements went by it. Here Increase and Cotton Mather, and all
magistrates and ministers, were entertained. Here the wants of the
poor and unfortunate were made known, and all men came for counsel and
advice. From the first, even when he had not reached the age of
maturity, he commanded to a singular extent the confidence and respect
of all men. The influence of his bearing and character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[i.168]</a></span> thus early
established, was never lost or abated, or disturbed for a moment
during his long life. He was the umpire to settle all differences, but
never made an enemy by his decisions. Although of moderate estate,
compared with some of his neighbors, they all treated him with a
deference greater than they sometimes paid to each other. It was his
lot to be mixed up with innumerable controversies, to be in the very
centre of the most vehement and frightful social convulsions, and to
act decisively in some of them; but it is most marvellous to witness
how uniform and universal was the consideration in which he was held.
These statements are justified abundantly by evidence in records and
documents.</p>

<p>When village business was to be transacted, or consultation of any
kind had, the house of Deacon Ingersoll was designated, as a matter of
course, for the place of meeting. Whether it was an ecclesiastical or
a military gathering, a prayer-meeting or a train-band drill, it was
there. Before they had a meeting-house, it cannot be doubted, they met
for worship in his large room. We find it recorded, that, after the
meeting-house was built, if from the bitterness of the weather, or any
other cause, it was too uncomfortable to remain in, they would adjourn
to Deacon Ingersoll's. Such a free use of a particular person's
premises sometimes engenders a familiarity that runs into license, and
is apt to breed contempt. Not so at all in his case. There was a
native-born dignity, an honest manliness and pervading integrity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[i.169]</a></span>
about him, that were appreciated by all persons at all times. When
wrong was meditated, his admonition was received with respectful
consideration; when it had been committed, his rebuke awakened no
resentment. The fact, that he was acknowledged and felt by all to be a
perfectly just man, is apparent through the whole course of his action
in all the affairs of life. His uprightness, freedom from unworthy
prejudice, and clear and transparent conscientiousness, appear in all
documents, depositions, and records that proceeded from him. He was
often called to give evidence in land causes and other trials at law;
and his testimony is always straightforward, fair, and lucid. You can
tell from the style, temper, or tone of other witnesses, which side of
the controversy they espoused, but not from his. In the great and
protracted conflict in the courts, relating to the Townsend Bishop
farm, he and all his most intimate connections and relatives were
parties of adverse interest; but Zerubabel Endicott paid homage, and
left it on record, to the truthfulness and uprightness of the
testimony and the fairness of the course of Nathaniel Ingersoll. We
shall meet other illustrations to the same effect in the course of our
narrative.</p>

<p>Although it is anticipating the course of events, it may be well to
trace the outlines of the life of this man to its distant close.
Partaking of the general views of his age, he participated in the
proceedings that led to the witchcraft prosecutions. He believed in
what was regarded as decisive evidence against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[i.170]</a></span> accused, and acted
accordingly. But no one ever felt that there was any vindictiveness in
his course.</p>

<p>He lived to see the storm that desolated his beloved village pass
away, and to enjoy the restoration of reason, peace, and good-will
among a people who had so long been torn by strife, and subjected to
untold horrors,&#8212;horrors that have never yet been fully described, and
which I despair of being able adequately to depict. He did all that a
good and true man could do to eradicate the causes of the mischief. He
participated in the exercises of a day of Thanksgiving, set apart for
the purpose, in 1700, to express the devout and contrite gratitude of
the people to a merciful God for deliverance from the errors and
passions that had overwhelmed them with such awful judgments. The
removal of Mr. Parris having been effected, Joseph Green was settled
near the close of the year 1697. He was a wise and prudent man. By
kind, cautious, and well-timed measures, he gradually succeeded in
extracting every root of bitterness, healing all the breaches, and
restoring harmony to a long-distracted people. In this work, Deacon
Ingersoll and his good associate, Edward Putnam, aided him to the
utmost. When, by their united counsels and labors, the difficult work
was about accomplished, Mr. Green was taken to his reward, in 1715.
Greatly was he lamented; but Nathaniel Ingersoll had realized all his
best wishes at last. The prayers he had poured forth for fifty years
had been answered. He had seen the completed service of a pastor who
had fulfilled his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[i.171]</a></span> highest estimate of what a Christian minister
should be. He lived to witness and share in the warm and unanimous
welcome of Peter Clark to a useful, honored, happy ministry which
lasted more than half a century. The ordination of Mr. Clark, which
took place on the 8th of June, 1717, was made the occasion of
demonstrating the complete re-establishment of social harmony and
Christian love throughout that entire community. The storms of strife
had commenced with the settlement of the first minister, more than
forty years before: they had increased in violence, until, at the
witchcraft delusion, they swept in a tornado every thing to ruin. The
clouds had been slowly dispersed, and the angry waves smoothed down,
by Mr. Green's benignant ministry. The long, and yet unbroken, &quot;era of
good feeling&quot; was fully inaugurated. It was a day of great rejoicing.
Old men and matrons, young men and maidens, met together in happy
union. Tradition says that they carried their grateful festivities to
the highest point allowable by the proprieties of that period. Having
witnessed this scene, and beheld the church and village of his
affections start on a new and sure career of peace and prosperity, the
Good Parishioner folded his mantle and departed from sight. He died in
1719, in his eighty-fifth year. He was truly the &quot;Man of Ross.&quot; The
celebrated portrait, which poetry has drawn under this name, was from
an actual example in real life, not more shining than his. He left no
issue; but his brothers were the founders of a family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[i.172]</a></span> widely
diffused, many members of which have, in every subsequent age,
contributed to the honor of the name. Innumerable branches have spread
out from the same stock under other names. The children of the late
Dr. Nathaniel Bowditch, through both father and mother, have descended
from a brother of Nathaniel Ingersoll.</p>

<p>Citations and extracts from documents on file will justify all I have
said of this man.</p>

<p>His wife was a spirit kindred to his own. Their only child, a
daughter, died when quite young. Their hearts demanded an object on
which to exercise parental affection, and to give opportunity for
benevolent care, within their own household; and they induced their
neighbor, Joseph Hutchinson, who had several sons, to give one of them
to be theirs by adoption. When this child had grown to manhood, a deed
was recorded in the Essex Registry, Oct. 2, 1691, of which this is the
purport:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Benjamin Hutchinson, being an infant when he was given to
us by his parents, we have brought him up as our own child;
and he, the said Benjamin, living with us as an obedient
son, until he came of one and twenty years of age, he then
marrying from us, I, the said Nathaniel Ingersoll, and
Hannah, my wife, on these considerations, do, upon the
marriage of our adopted son, Benjamin Hutchinson, give and
bequeath to him, his heirs and assigns for ever, this deed
of gift of ten acres of upland, and also three acres of
meadow,&quot; &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>When Mr. Parris was settled, it occurred to Deacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[i.173]</a></span> Ingersoll, that it
would be very convenient for him to have a certain piece of ground
between the parsonage land and the Andover road; and he gave him a
deed, from which the following is an extract. It is dated Jan. 2,
1689.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;To all Christian people to whom this present writing shall
come, Nathaniel Ingersoll, of Salem Village, in the county
of Essex, sendeth greeting. Know ye, that the said Nathaniel
Ingersoll, husbandman, and Hannah, his wife, for and in
consideration of the love, respect, and honor which they
justly bear unto the public worship of the true and only
God, and therefore for the encouragement of their
well-beloved pastor, the Rev. Samuel Parris, who hath lately
taken that office amongst them, and also for and in
consideration of a very small sum of money to them in hand
paid, with which they do acknowledge themselves fully
contented and satisfied, do grant to said Samuel Parris and
Elizabeth, his wife, for life, and then to the children of
said Samuel and Elizabeth Parris, four and a half acres of
land, adjoining upon the home field of the said Nathaniel
Ingersoll; the three acres on the south alienated by gift,
and the remainder by sale.&quot;</p></div>

<p>There was a fine young orchard on the land.</p>

<p>Joseph Houlton had conveyed to the parish a lot for the use of the
ministry, attached to the parsonage house. A question having arisen in
consequence of a lost deed, or some other imagined defect in the
Houlton title, whether the land originally belonged to him or to
Nathaniel Ingersoll, the latter disposed of it at once by an
instrument recorded in the Essex Registry, of which the following is
the substance:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[i.174]</a></span>&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Nathaniel Ingersoll to the Trustees of Salem Village
Ministry land, for divers good causes and considerations me
thereunto moving, but more especially for the true love and
desire I have to the peace and welfare of Salem Village
wherein I dwell, I hereby release, &amp;c., all my right and
title to five acres described in my brother Houlton's deed
of sale,&quot; &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>In the same Registry, the following extract is found, in a deed dated
Jan. 28, 1708:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;For the desire I have that children may be educated in
Salem Village, I freely give four poles square of land to
Rev. Joseph Green, to have and to hold the same, not for his
own particular use, but for the setting a schoolhouse upon,
and the encouragement of a school in this place.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The Essex Registry has a deed dated Jan. 6, 1714, of which the
following is the substance:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;For the good affection that I bear unto Deacon Edward
Putnam, and the desire that I have of his comfortable
attendance upon the public worship of God, I have freely
given unto him, the said Deacon Edward Putnam, of Salem
aforesaid, for him and his heirs for ever, a piece of land,
bounded northerly upon the land of Joseph Green, next to his
orchard gate, westerly on the highway, and southerly and
easterly on my land.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Deacon Putnam was, at this time, sixty years of age. His homestead was
at some distance; and it was often difficult for him to get to
meeting. Ingersoll had always enjoyed the convenience of having only a
few rods to go to the place of worship; and he desired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[i.175]</a></span> have his
beloved colleague enjoy the same privilege. Besides, he longed to have
him near. The proffer was probably accepted. We find that
church-meetings were held at the house of Deacon Putnam, which would
not probably so often have been the case, had he remained on his farm;
and we know that there were two dwelling-houses, some time afterwards,
on the Ingersoll lot. It was a pleasant arrangement: the two deacons
and the minister being thus brought close together, and reaching each
other through Ingersoll's garden and the minister's orchard. Of the
personal friendship, attachment, and genial affection between the two
good old deacons, the foregoing extract is a pleasing illustration.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Ingersoll's property was never very large; and, as he had
enjoyed the luxury, all his life long, of benevolence and beneficence,
there was no great amount to be left after suitably providing for his
wife. But there was enough to enable him to express the family
affection to which he was always true, and to give a parting assurance
of his devotion to the church and people of the village. By his will,
certain legacies were required to be paid by the residuary legatee and
final heir within a reasonable time specified in the document. It
bears date July 8, 1709, and was offered for Probate, Feb. 17, 1719.
It begins thus:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;In the name of God, Amen. I, Nathaniel Ingersoll, of Salem,
in the county of Essex, in the Province of <span lang="el" title="[Transcriber's note: so in original]">Massachutetts</span>
 Bay, in New England,
being through God's mercy in good health of body and of
perfect memory, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[i.176]</a></span> knowing how soon my great change
may come, do make this my last will, in manner and form
following: First, I give up my soul to God, in and through
Jesus Christ my Redeemer, when he shall please to call for
it, hoping for a glorious resurrection, in and through his
merits; and my body to decent burial, at the discretion of
my executors; and, as for the worldly estate God hath been
pleased to give me, I dispose of it in the manner
following,&quot; &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>He gives a small sum of money, varying from thirty shillings to four
pounds, to each and every nephew and niece then living, twenty-two in
number. He provides for an annuity of twenty shillings a year for a
sister, the only remaining member of his own immediate family, to be
paid into the hands of the daughter who took care of her. Not being
able to leave a large amount to any, he preferred to express his love
for all. There were two items in the will which may be specially
preserved from oblivion.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;I give to the church in Salem Village the sum of fifty
shillings in money, for the more adorning the Lord's Table,
to be laid out in some silver cup, at the discretion of the
Pastor, Deacons, and my overseers.&quot;&#8212;&quot;After my wife's
decease, I give to Benjamin (my adopted son) who was very
dutiful to me, while he lived with me, and helpful to me
since he has gone from me, all the remaining part of my
whole estate, both real and personal,&#8212;excepting a small
parcel of land of about two acres, that lyeth between M<sup>rs.</sup>
Walcots and George Wyotts by the highway, which I give to
the inhabitants of Salem Village, for a training place for
ever.&quot;</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[i.177]</a></span></p>

<p>The bonds required of the executors by the Probate Court were to the
amount of two hundred pounds only, showing that his movable or
personal estate was a very moderate one. There is a feature in the
will, which is, I think, worthy of being mentioned, as evincing the
excellent judgment and practical wisdom of this man.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;I give to Hannah, my well-beloved wife, the use and
improvement of my whole estate during her natural life: and
my will is, that, if my wife should marry again, he that she
so marrieth, before she marry, shall give sufficient
security to my overseers not to make strip or waste upon any
of my estate; and, if he do not become so bound, I give
one-half of my whole estate to Benjamin Hutchinson, at the
time of my wife's marriage.&quot;</p></div>

<p>He did not cut her off entirely, as is sometimes attempted to be done,
in the event of a second marriage, but secured her and the estate
against suffering in case she took that step. He adopted an effectual
method to prevent any one from seeking to marry her for the purpose of
getting the benefit of her whole income and a comfortable
establishment upon his property without providing for its
preservation; and, if she should be so improvident as to marry again
without having his conditions complied with, he took care that she
should not thereby expose to injury or loss more than one-half of his
estate. Ingenuity is much exercised in making wills, particularly in
reference to the rights, interests, and security of wives. It is
worthy of consideration, whether, all things considered, Nathaniel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[i.178]</a></span>
Ingersoll's plan is not about as skilful and just as any that has been
devised.</p>

<p>We shall meet this man again in the course of our story. I trust to
your good feeling in vindication of the space I have given to his
biography; being strongly impressed with a conviction, that you will
agree with me,&#8212;taking into view the influence he constantly exerted,
his steadfast integrity and honor, his personal dignity and public
spirit,&#8212;that the life of this citizen of a retired rural community,
this plain &quot;husbandman,&quot; is itself a monument to his memory more truly
glorious than many which have been reared to perpetuate the names of
men whom the world has called great. The &quot;training place&quot; has been
carefully preserved. Occupying a central point, by the side of the
principal street, this pretty lawn is a fitting memorial of the Father
of the village. In its proper character, as a training-field, it is
invested with an interest not elsewhere surpassed, if equalled. Within
its enclosure the elements of the military art have been imparted to a
greater number of persons distinguished in their day, and who have
left an imperishable glory behind them as the defenders of the
country, a brave yeomanry in arms, than on any other spot. It was
probably used as a training field at the first settlement of the
village. From the slaughter of Bloody Brook, the storming of the
Narragansett Fort, and all the early Indian wars; from the Heights of
Abraham, Lake George, Lexington, Bunker Hill, Brandywine, Pea Ridge,
and a hundred other battle-fields, a lustre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[i.179]</a></span> is reflected back upon
this village parade-ground. It is associated with all the military
traditions of the country, down to the late Rebellion. Lothrop,
Davenport, Gardners, Dodges, Raymonds, Putnams, Porters, Hutchinsons,
Herricks, Flints, and others, who here taught or learned the manual
and drill, are names inscribed on the rolls of history for deeds of
heroism and prowess.</p>

<p>There was the usual diversity and variety of character among the
people of the village. John Procter originally lived in Ipswich, where
he, as well as his father before him, had a farm of considerable
value. In 1666, or about that time, he removed to Salem, and carried
on the Downing farm, which had before been leased to the Flints. After
a while, Procter purchased a part of it. If a conclusion can be drawn
from the prevalent type of his posterity of our day, he was a man of
herculean frame. There is, I think, a tradition to this effect. At any
rate, his character was of that stamp. He had great native force and
energy. He was bold in his spirit and in his language,&#8212;an upright
man, no doubt, as the whole tone of the memorials of him indicate, but
free and imprudent in speech, impulsive in feeling, and sometimes rash
in action. He was liable from this cause, as we shall see, to get into
contention and give offence. There was Jeremiah Watts, a
representative of a class of men existing in every community where the
intellect is stimulated and idiosyncrasies allowed to develop
themselves. By occupation he was a dish-turner, but by temperament an
enthu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[i.180]</a></span>siast, a zealot, and an agitator. He was not satisfied with
things as they were, nor willing to give time an opportunity to
improve them. He took hold of the horns of the altar with daring
hands. He denounced the Church and the world,&#8212;undertook to overturn
every thing, and to put all on a new foundation. He entered on a
crusade against what he called &quot;pulpit preaching,&quot; whereby particular
persons, called ministers, &quot;may deliver what they please, and none
must object; and this we must pay largely for; our bread must be taken
out of our mouths, to maintain the beast's mark; and be wholly
deprived of our Christian privileges. This is the time of Antichrist's
reign, and he must reign this time: now are the witnesses slain, and
the leaders in churches are these slayers. But I see plainly that it
is a vain thing to debate about these things with our fellow-brethren;
for they are all for lording it, and trampling under foot.&quot; This man
imagined that he &quot;was singled out alone to give his testimony for
Christ, discovering Antichrist's marks.&quot; &quot;If any,&quot; he cried out, &quot;will
be faithful for Christ, they must witness against Antichrist, which is
self-love, and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. The
witnesses are now slain, but shortly they will rise again,&quot; &amp;c. He
tried to get up &quot;private Christian meetings,&quot; to run an opposition to
&quot;pulpit preaching.&quot; After going about from house to house, declaiming
in this style, denouncing all who would not fall in with his notions
and act with him, and not succeeding in overthrowing things in
general, he hit upon a new ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[i.181]</a></span>pedient. As his neighbors had wit enough
to let him alone, and did not suffer themselves to be tempted to
resort to the civil power to make him keep quiet, he did it himself.
He instituted proceedings against the ministers and churches, on the
charge, that, by taking the rule into their own hands, they were
supplanting the magistrates and usurping the civil power. This was not
in itself a bad move; but the Court wisely declined to engage in the
proceedings. They neither prosecuted the case nor him, but let the
whole go by. They adhered severely to the do-nothing policy. What a
world of mischief would have been avoided, if all courts, everywhere,
at all times, had shown an equal wisdom! Watts was allowed to vex the
village, torment the minister, and perplex those who listened to him
by the ingenuity and ability with which he urged his views. He
continued his brawling declamations until he was tired; but, not being
noticed by ministers or magistrates, no great harm was done, and he
probably subsided into a quiet and respectable citizen.</p>

<p>The prominent place Giles Corey is to occupy in the scene before us
renders an account of him particularly necessary. It is not easy to
describe him. He was a very singular person. His manner of life and
general bearing and conversation were so disregardful, in many
particulars, of the conventional proprieties of his day, that it is
not safe to receive implicitly the statements made by his
contemporaries. By his peculiarities of some sort, he got a bad name.
In the Book of Records of the First Church in Salem, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[i.182]</a></span> his public
profession of religion is recorded, he is spoken of as a man of eighty
years of age, and of a &quot;scandalous life,&quot; but who made a confession of
his sins satisfactory to that body. It cannot be denied that he was
regarded in this light by some; but there is no reason to believe,
that, in referring to the sinfulness of his past life, the old man
meant more than was usually understood by such language on such
occasions. He was often charged with criminal acts; but in every
instance the charge was proved to be either wholly unfounded or
greatly exaggerated. He had a good many contentions and rough
passages; but they were the natural consequences, when a bold and
strong man was put upon the defensive, or drawn to the offensive, by
the habit of inconsiderate aspersion into which some of his neighbors
had been led, and the bad repute put upon him by scandal-mongers. He
was evidently an industrious, hard-working man. He was a person of
some means, a holder of considerable property in lands and other
forms. Deeds are often found on record from and to him. He owned
meadows near Ipswich River. His homestead, during the last thirty
years of his life, was a farm of more than a hundred acres of very
valuable land, which has been in the possession of the family, now
owning it, for a hundred years. The present proprietor, Mr. Benjamin
Taylor, some twenty years ago, ploughed up the site of Corey's
dwelling-house; the vestiges of the cellar being then quite visible.
It was near the crossing of the Salem and Lowell, and Georgetown and
Boston Railroads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[i.183]</a></span> about three hundred feet to the west of the
crossing, and close to the track of the former road, on its south
side. The spot is surrounded by beautiful fields; and their aspect
shows that it must have been, in all respects, an eligible estate.
What is now known as &quot;the Curtis Field&quot; is a part of Corey's farm.</p>

<p>Giles Corey lived previously, for some time, in the town of Salem. He
sold his house there in 1659. The contract with a carpenter for
building his farmhouse is preserved. It was stipulated to be erected
&quot;where he shall appoint.&quot; While the carpenter was getting out the
materials, he selected and bought the farm, on which he lived ever
afterwards. The house was to be &quot;twenty feet in length, fifteen in
breadth, and eight feet stud.&quot; Nothing strikes us more, as strange and
unaccountable, than the small size of houses in those days. One would
have thought, that, where wood was so plenty and near at hand, and
land of no account, they would have built larger houses. In a letter,
dated Nov. 16, 1646, from Governor Winthrop to his son John, of
Connecticut, he gives an account &quot;of a tempest (than which I never
observed a greater);&quot; and mentions that the roof of &quot;Lady Moody's
house, at Salem,&quot; with all of the chimney above it, was blown off in
two parts, and &quot;carried six or eight rods. Ten persons lay under it,
and knew not of it till they arose in the morning.&quot; The house had a
flat roof, was of one story, and nine feet in height! Lady Deborah
Moody was a person of high position, a connection of Sir Henry Vane,
and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[i.184]</a></span> woman of property. She bought Mr. Humphreys' great plantation.
But, like Townsend Bishop, she was dealt with, and compelled to quit
the colony, on account of her doubts about infant baptism. Winthrop
calls her a &quot;wise and anciently religious woman.&quot; She went to Long
Island, where her influence was so important, that Governor Stuyvesant
consulted her in his administration, and conceded to her the
nomination of magistrates. It seems very strange that such a lady
should have had a house only nine feet high. The early houses were
built either as temporary structures or with a view to enlargement.
Perhaps Lady Moody intended to add a story to hers. They were
low-studded for warmth. The farm-houses generally were designed to be
increased in length, when convenience required. The chimney was very
large, placed at one end, and so constructed, that, on the extension
of the building, fire-places could be opened into it on the new end. A
building of twenty feet was prepared to become one of forty feet in
width or length, as the case might be; and then the chimney would be
in the middle of it.</p>

<p>As has been intimated, Corey was in bad repute. Either he was a
lawless man, or much misunderstood. I am inclined to the latter
opinion. He belonged to that class of persons, instances of which we
occasionally meet, who care little about the opinions or the talk of
others. On one occasion, he was going into town with a cartload of
wood. He met Anthony Needham, in company with John Procter whose
house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[i.185]</a></span> he had just passed. Procter accosted him thus: &quot;How now, Giles,
wilt thou never leave thy old trade? Thou hast got some of my wood
here upon thy cart.&quot; Corey answered, &quot;True, I did take two or three
sticks to lay behind the cart to ease the oxen, because they bore too
hard.&quot; This shows the free way in which Procter bantered with Corey,
and the slight account the latter made of it. But the thing before
long got to be too serious to be trifled with. It became the fashion
to charge all sorts of offences against Corey; and, whatever any one
lost or mislaid, he was considered as having abstracted it. The gossip
against him was quite unrestrained, and created a bitter and angry
feeling in the neighborhood. In the winter of 1676, a man named
Goodell, who had been working on Corey's farm, was carried home to his
friends by Corey's wife, in a feeble state of health, and died soon
after. It was whispered about, and before long openly asserted, that
he had come to his death in consequence of having been violently
beaten by Corey, who was accordingly arrested and brought to trial for
killing the man. There was a great excitement against him. He probably
had punished the man severely for some alleged misconduct; and it was
charged that the castigation had been so unmerciful and excessive as
to have broken down his constitution and caused his death. There was
conflicting evidence going to show that the man had been beaten, for
some misconduct, after he had returned to his family. It was a
circumstance in favor of Corey, that his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[i.186]</a></span> had taken the invalid
to his home; and there was no evidence of any ill feeling between her
and the sick man during a stop they made at Procter's house on their
way. The death, too, it was supposed by some, might have resulted from
ordinary disease, and not from whipping, either at Corey's or at home.
The result was, that, notwithstanding the prejudice against Corey, he
was discharged on paying a fine; showing that the Court did not
consider it a very serious offence. We shall hear of this affair
again.</p>

<p>In the year 1678, there was a suit at law between Corey and a man
named John Gloyd, a laborer on his farm, on a question of wages. The
case was, by agreement of the parties, passed out of court into the
hands of arbitrators mutually chosen. John Procter was one of the
arbitrators, and, as it would seem, chosen as the friend of Gloyd:
Nathaniel Putnam and Edmund Bridges were the others; one of them
chosen by Corey, and the other mutually agreed upon. They brought in
their award. Its precise character is not stated; but the
circumstances indicate that it was favorable to Gloyd. The conduct of
Corey on this occasion shows, that, though a rough man perhaps, and
liable, from his peculiar ways, to be harshly spoken of, he had, after
all, a generous, forgiving, and genial nature. Nathaniel Putnam and
Edmund Bridges state, that, when they brought in their award, &quot;it was
greatly to the satisfaction of the parties concerned; and Giles Corey
did manifest as much satisfaction, and gave as many thanks to every
one of us, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[i.187]</a></span> ever we heard; and Goodman Corey did manifest, to our
observation, as much satisfaction to John Procter as he did to the
rest of the arbitrators.&quot; Captain Moore, being by when the award was
brought in, says, &quot;I did see and take notice of the abundance of love
manifested from Corey to Procter, and from Procter to Corey: for they
drank wine together; and Procter paid for part, and Corey for part.&quot;</p>

<p>This remarkable overflow of affection between these two men is
rendered interesting, not merely by the collisions into which, before
and after, their impulsive and imprudent natures brought them, but by
the part they were destined to enact in an impending tragedy, which
was to bring them to a fearful end in a manner and on a scene that
will arrest the notice of all ages, and attest to their strong
characters and heroic spirit. The passage has a unique interest, and
is worthy of a painter.</p>

<p>It happened unfortunately, that, a few days after the loving embraces
of these hardy men, Procter's house took fire. According to their
habit, some of the neighbors at once started the idea, that Corey had
set fire to it because of the award of the arbitrators, of whom
Procter was one. Under the excitement of the conflagration, with his
usual rashness, and forgetting the pledges of reconciliation that had
just passed between them, Procter fell in with the accusation, and
Corey was brought to trial. It appeared, in evidence, that John Phelps
and Thomas Fuller, who lived on the western borders of the village,
near Ipswich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[i.188]</a></span> River, coming along the road towards Procter's Corner
about two hours before daylight, on the way probably to Salem market,
saw his roof on fire, gave the alarm, and stopped to help put it out.
Thomas Gould and Thomas Flint thought it must be the work of an
incendiary, or of &quot;an evil hand,&quot; as they expressed it, from the place
where it took and the hour when it occurred. On the other hand, it was
testified by James Poland and Caleb and Jane Moore, that they heard
John Procter say that his boy carried a lamp and set the fire by
accident. This was said by him, probably before the idea of Corey's
agency in the matter had been put into his head. The prisoner proved
an <i>alibi</i> by the most conclusive evidence, which is so curious, as
giving an insight of a farmer's life at that time, and of Corey's
domestic condition, that it may well be inserted.</p>

<p>Abraham Walcot testifies, that, &quot;Tuesday night last was a week, I
lodged at Giles Corey's house, which night John Procter's house was
damaged by fire; and Giles Corey went to bed before nine o'clock, and
rose about sunrise again, and could not have gone out of the house but
I should have heard him; and it must have been impossible that he
should have gone to Procter's house that night; for he cannot in a
long time go afoot, and, for his horse-kind, they were all in the
woods. And further testifieth, that said Corey came home very weary
from work, and went to bed the rather.&quot; His wife testified that he was
in bed from nine o'clock until sunrise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[i.189]</a></span></p>

<p>John Parker, one of Corey's four sons-in-law, testified as follows: &quot;I
being at work with my father, Goodman Corey, the day Goodman Procter's
house was on fire. I going home with my father the night before, he
complained that he was very weary, and said he would go to bed. I did,
on our way going, ask him whether or no he would eat his supper: my
father answered me again, no, he could not eat any thing that night;
and so went to bed, and so I left him abed. And, the next morning, my
father came to me about sun-rising, and asked me to go with Abraham
Walcot to fetch a load of hay; and my father said he would try whether
or not he could cart up a load of peas. I do also testify that he had
no horse-kind near at home at that time.&quot;</p>

<p>John Gloyd, the hired man, with whom he had the lawsuit that had been
settled a day or two before by arbitrators, testified, in
corroboration of Parker, and to show that the latter could not have
had any thing to do with the fire, that he slept in the same room with
said Parker that night, and that he came to bed between nine and ten
o'clock in the evening, and never rose until the break of day. Gloyd's
wife testified to the same effect. There turned out to be no evidence
against Corey whatever, but abundant proof of his innocence. The
hard-working, &quot;weary&quot; old man was triumphantly acquitted. He thought,
however, from this high-handed and utterly groundless attempt to wrong
and ruin him, and from calumnious general statements that had been
made against him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[i.190]</a></span> course of the trial, that it was time to put
a stop to the malignant and mischievous slanders which had been
current in the neighborhood. He instituted prosecutions of Procter and
others for defamation, and recovered against them all. After this, we
hear no more of him until he experienced religion and was received
into the First Church. Whether he and Procter became reconciled again
is not known. Probably they did; for they seem to have had points of
attraction, and each of them traits of kind-heartedness and
generosity, under a rather rough exterior. The manner in which they
bore themselves in their last hours is a matter of history, and stamps
them both with true manliness.</p>

<p>The incidents which have now been related, and the peculiar traits of
this man, are perhaps sufficient to account for the fact, that he was
spoken of as a person of &quot;a scandalous&quot; life. He had afforded food for
scandal; and it is not surprising, that, in a rural community, where
but few topics for talk occur beyond the village boundaries, all
should have participated, more or less, in criticising his ways, and
that the various difficulties into which he had been drawn, and the
charges against him, should have made him the object of much
prejudice. His wife Martha was also a noticeable character. She was a
professor of religion, a member of the village church, and found her
chief happiness in attendance upon public worship and in private
devotions. Much of her time&#8212;indeed, all that she could rescue from
the labors of the household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[i.191]</a></span>&#8212;was spent in prayer. She was a woman of
spirit and pluck, as we shall see.</p>

<p>Another notability of the village was Bridget Bishop. In 1666&#8212;then
the widow Wasselbe&#8212;she was married to Thomas Oliver. After his death,
she became the wife of Edward Bishop, who is spoken of as a &quot;sawyer.&quot;
This term did not describe the same occupation then to which it is
almost wholly applied now. Firewood, in those days, was not, as a
general thing, sawed, but chopped. The sawyer got out boards and
joists, beams, and timber of all kinds, from logs; and before mills
were constructed, or where they were not conveniently accessible, it
was an indispensable employment, and held a high rank among the
departments of useful industry. It was in constant requisition in
shipyards. It was a manly form of labor, requiring a considerable
outlay of apparatus, and developing finely the whole muscular
organization. The implement employed, beside the ordinary tools, such
as wedges, beetles, the broad-axe, chains, and crowbar, was a strong
steel cutting-plate, of great breadth, with large teeth, highly
polished and thoroughly wrought, some eight or ten feet in length,
with a double handle, crossing the plate at each end at a right angle.
It was worked by two men, and called a &quot;pit-saw,&quot; because sometimes
the man at the lower handle stood in a deep pit, dug for the purpose,
and called a &quot;saw-pit.&quot; But, among the early settlers, the usual
method was to make a frame of strong timbers. The log to be sawed was
raised by slings, or slid up an inclined plane, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[i.192]</a></span> placed upon
cross-beams. Above it, a scaffolding was made on which one man stood;
the other stood on the ground below. They each held the saw by both
hands, and worked in unison. The log was pushed along by handspikes as
they reached the cross-timbers, and wedges were used to keep the cleft
open, that the saw might work free. So important was this business
considered, that, from time to time, the General Court regulated by
law the rates of pay to the sawyer. If a farmer had suitable
woodlands, he provided in many cases a saw-frame or saw-pit of his
own, got out his logs, and worked them into boards or square timber
for sale. This was a profitable business.</p>

<p>Edward Bishop had resided, for some seven years previous to the
witchcraft delusion, within the limits of Salem, near the Beverly
line. His wife Bridget was a singular character, not easily described.
She kept a house of refreshment for travellers, and a shovel-board for
the entertainment of her guests, and generally seems to have
countenanced amusements and gayeties to an extent that exposed her to
some scandal. She is described as wearing &quot;a black cap and a black
hat, and a red paragon bodice,&quot; bordered and looped with different
colors. This would appear to have been rather a showy costume for the
times. Her freedom from the austerity of Puritan manners, and
disregard of conventional decorum in her conversation and conduct,
brought her into disrepute; and the tongue of gossip was generally
loosened against her. She was charged with witchcraft, and actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[i.193]</a></span>
brought to trial on the charge, in 1680, but was acquitted; the
popular mind not being quite ripe for such proceedings as took place
twelve years afterwards. She still continued to brave public
sentiment, lived on in the same free and easy style, paying no regard
to the scowls of the sanctimonious or the foolish tittle-tattle of the
superstitious. She kept her house of entertainment, shovel-board, and
other appurtenances. Sometimes, however, she resented the calumnies
circulated about her being a witch, in a manner that made it to be
felt that it was best to let her alone. A man called one day at the
house of Samuel Shattuck, where there was a sick child. He was a
stranger to the inmates of the family, and evidently had come to the
place to make trouble for Bridget Bishop. He pretended great pity for
the child, and said, among other things, in an oracular way, &quot;We are
all born, some to one thing, and some to another.&quot; The mother asked
him what he thought her poor, suffering child was born to. He replied,
&quot;He is born to be bewitched, and is bewitched: you have a neighbor,
that lives not far off, who is a witch.&quot; The good woman does not
appear to have entertained any suspicion of the kind; but the man
insisted on the truth of what he had affirmed. He succeeded in
exciting her feelings on the subject, and, by vague insinuations and
general descriptions of the witch, led her mind to fix upon Bridget
Bishop. He said he should go and see her, and that he could bring her
out as the afflicter of her child. She consented to let another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[i.194]</a></span> of
her boys go with him, and show the way. They proceeded to the house,
and knocked at the door. Bridget opened it, and asked what he would
have: he said a pot of cider. There was something in the manner of the
man which satisfied her that he had come with mischievous intent. She
ordered him off, seized a spade that happened to be near, drove him
out of her porch, and chased him from her premises. When he and the
boy got back, they bore marks of the bad luck of the adventure. Such
things had perhaps happened before, and it was found that whoever
provoked her resentment was very likely to come off second best from
the encounter; yet Bridget was a member of Mr. Hale's Church in
Beverly, and retained her standing in full fellowship there. It must
have been thought, by the pastor and members of that church, that no
charge seriously affecting her moral or Christian character was justly
imputable to her.</p>

<p>The traveller of to-day, in passing over Crane-river Bridge,
approaching the present village of &quot;The Plains,&quot; near the eastern end
of the Townsend Bishop or Nurse farm, will notice a roadway by the
side of the bridge descending through the brook and going up to rejoin
the main road on the other side. Such turnouts are frequent by the
side of bridges over small streams. They are refreshing and useful,
cooling the feet and cleansing the fetlocks of horses, and washing the
wheels of carriages. One afternoon, Edward Bishop, with his wife
behind him on a pillion, was riding home from Salem. Two women,
mounted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[i.195]</a></span> the same way, joined them; and they chatted together
pleasantly as their horses ambled along. When they came to the bridge,
Bishop, probably merely for the fun of the thing, dashed down into the
brook, instead of going over the bridge, to the great consternation
and against the vehement remonstrances of his wife, who berated him
soundly for his reckless disregard of her safety. They got through
without accident; and the four jogged on together until the Bishops
turned up to their house, and the other two kept on to their home in
Beverly. But all the way from the bridge, until they parted company,
Bishop was finding great fault with his wife, saying that he should
not have been sorry if any mishap had occurred. She did not say much
after her first fright and resentment were over; but he kept on
talking very freely about her, and using some pretty hard language.
This affair, which perhaps is not without a parallel in the occasional
experiences of married life, was, with other things of an equally
trivial and irrelevant character, brought to bear fatally against her
at her trial on the charge of witchcraft, between seven and eight
years afterward.</p>

<p>I can find no evidence against the moral character of this woman. One
person, at least, who participated largely in getting up accusations
against her, acknowledged, in a death-bed repentance, the wrong she
had done. Mr. Hale, the minister of the Beverly congregation, states,
in a deposition, that a certain woman, &quot;being in full communion in our
church, came to me to desire that Goodwife Bishop, her neighbor, wife
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[i.196]</a></span> Edward Bishop, Jr., might not be permitted to receive the Lord's
Supper in our church till she had given her satisfaction for some
offences that were against her; namely, because the said Bishop did
entertain people in her house at unseasonable hours in the night, to
keep drinking and playing at shovel-board, whereby discord did arise
in other families, and young people were in danger to be corrupted;
that she knew these things, and had once gone into the house, and,
finding some at shovel-board, had taken the pieces they played with
and thrown them into the fire, and had reproved the said Bishop for
promoting such disorders, but received no satisfaction from her about
it.&quot; According to Mr. Hale's statement, the night after this complaint
was brought to him, the woman was found to be distracted. &quot;She
continuing some time distracted, we sought the Lord by fasting and
prayer.&quot; After a while, the woman recovered her senses, and, as Mr.
Hale says he understood, expressed a suspicion &quot;that she had been
bewitched by Bishop's wife.&quot; He declares that he did not, at the time,
countenance the idea, &quot;hoping better of Goody Bishop.&quot; He says
further, that he &quot;inquired of Margaret King, who kept at or near the
house,&quot; what she had observed concerning the woman who had been
distracted. &quot;She told me that she was much given to reading and
searching the prophecies of Scripture.&quot; At length the woman appeared
to have entirely recovered, went to Goody Bishop, gave satisfaction
for what she had said and done against her, and they became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[i.197]</a></span> friends
again. Mr. Hale goes on to say, &quot;I was oft praying with and
counselling of her before her death.&quot; She earnestly desired that
&quot;Edward Bishop might be sent for, that she might make friends with
him. I asked her if she had wronged Edward Bishop. She said, not that
she knew of, unless it were in taking his shovel-board pieces, when
people were at play with them, and throwing them into the fire; and,
if she did evil in it, she was very sorry for it, and desired he would
be friends with her, or forgive her. This was the very day before she
died.&quot; That night her distemper returned, and, in a paroxysm of
insanity, she destroyed herself.</p>

<p>It is evident, from his own account, that Mr. Hale did not then fall
in with, or countenance at all, any unfavorable impressions against
Bridget Bishop; and that the poor diseased woman, when entirely free
from her malady, repented bitterly of what she had done and said of
Goodman Bishop and his wife, and heartily desired their forgiveness.
So far as the facts stated by Mr. Hale of his own knowledge go, they
prove that Bridget Bishop was the victim of gross misrepresentation.
Five years afterwards, as we shall see, Mr. Hale gave a very different
version of the affair, and one which it is extremely difficult to
reconcile with his own former deliberate convictions at the time when
the circumstances occurred.</p>

<p>As it is my object to bring before you every thing that may help to
explain the particular occurrences embraced in the account I am to
give of the witchcraft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[i.198]</a></span> prosecutions, two other persons must be
mentioned before concluding this branch of my subject,&#8212;George Jacobs,
Sr., and his son George Jacobs, Jr. They each had given offence to
some persons, and suffered that sort of notoriety which led to the
selection of victims, although both were persons of respectability.
The father owned and had lived for about a half-century on a farm in
North Fields, on the banks of Endicott River, a little to the eastward
of the bridge at the iron-foundery. He was a person of good estate and
an estimable man; but it was his misfortune to have an impulsive
nature and quick passions. In June, 1677, he was prosecuted and fined
for striking a man who had incensed him. George Jacobs, Jr., his only
son, at a court held Nov. 7, 1674, was prosecuted, &quot;found blamable,
and ordered to pay costs of court.&quot; His offence and defence are
embraced in his deposition on the occasion.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;<span class="smcap">George Jacobs's Answer to Nathaniel Putnam's
Complaint.</span>&#8212;That I did follow some horses in our
enclosure on the Royal Side, where they were trespassing
upon us; that the end of my following them was to take them;
but, rather than they would be taken, they took the water,
and I did follow them no further; but straightway they
turned ashore, and I did run to take them as they came out
of the water, but could not: and I can truly take my oath
that since that time I did never follow any horses or mares;
and I hope my own oath will clear me.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The result of his attempt to drive off the horses was, that several
valuable animals were drowned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[i.199]</a></span> Their owner, Nathaniel Putnam, brought
an action; but he could not recover damages. The horses were evidently
trespassing, and the Court did not seem to regard Jacobs's conduct as
a heinous matter. It is not to be supposed, that Nathaniel Putnam
harbored sentiments of revenge or resentment for eighteen years, or
had any hand in prosecuting Jacobs in 1692. There is every indication
that he did not sympathize in the violent passions which raged on that
occasion, although he was much under the power of the delusion. But
the affair of drowning the horses was probably for a long time a topic
of gossip, and may have given to the author of the catastrophe a
notoriety which nearly cost him his life.</p>

<p>The account that has been given of the elements of the population of
the Salem Farms or Village, shows that, while there were the usual
varieties entering into the composition of all communities, it is
wholly inadmissible to suppose that the witchcraft delusion took place
there because it was the scene of greater ignorance or stupidity or
barbarism than prevailed elsewhere. This will be made more apparent
still by some general views of the state of society and manners. The
people of a remote age are in general only regarded as they are seen
through prominent occurrences and public movements. These constitute
the ordinary materials of history. Dynasties, reigns of kings, armies,
legislative proceedings, large ecclesiastical synods, dogmatic creeds,
and the like, are, as a general thing, about all we know of the past.
Por<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[i.200]</a></span>traits of individuals appear here and there; but, separated from
the ordinary life of the times, they cannot be fairly or fully
appreciated. The public life of the past is but the outline, or, more
strictly speaking, the mere skeleton, of humanity. To fill up the
outline, to clothe the skeleton with elastic nerves and warm flesh,
and quicken it with a vital circulation, we must get at the domestic,
social, familiar, and ordinary experience of individuals and private
persons; we must obtain a view of the popular customs and the daily
routine of life. In this way only can history fulfil its office in
making the past present.</p>

<p>The people of the early colonial settlements had a private and
interior life, as much as we have now, and the people of all ages and
countries have had. It is common to regard them in no other light than
as a severe, sombre, and pleasure-abhorring generation. It was not so
with them altogether. They had the same nature that we have. It was
not all gloom and severity. They had their recreations, amusements,
gayeties, and frolics. Youth was as buoyant with hope and gladness,
love as warm and tender, mirth as natural to innocence, wit as
sprightly, then as now. There was as much poetry and romance: the
merry laugh enlivened the newly opened fields, and rang through the
bordering woods as loud, jocund, and unrestrained as in these older
and more crowded settlements. It is true that their theology was
austere, and their polity, in Church and State, stern; but, in their
modes of life, there were some features which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[i.201]</a></span> gave peculiar
opportunity to exercise and gratify a love of social excitement of a
pleasurable kind. Let me mention some of the customs having a tendency
in this direction, that prevailed in the early settlements of New
England.</p>

<p>Whenever a young man had made his clearing in the forest, got out the
frame of his house, and selected a helpmeet to dwell with him in it,
there was &quot;a raising.&quot; On an appointed day, the neighbors far and near
assembled; all together put their shoulders to the work; and, before
the shadows of night enveloped the scene, the house was up, and
covered from sill to ridgepole. The same was done if the house of a
neighbor had been destroyed by fire. In this case, often the timbers,
joists, and boards were contributed as well as the labor. These were
made the occasions of general merriment, in which all ages and both
sexes participated. Then there were the &quot;huskings.&quot; After the barns
were filled with hay and grain, and the corn was ripe, at &quot;harvest
home,&quot; gatherings would be seen on the bright autumnal afternoons of
successive days, in the neighborhood of the different farmhouses. The
sheaves would be taken from the shocks and brought up from the fields,
the golden leaves and milky tassels stripped from the full ear, and
the crib filled to the brim. These were scenes of unalloyed enjoyment
and unrestrained gayety.</p>

<p>At that time were prevalent, in rural neighborhoods, other recreations
promotive of social hilarity to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[i.202]</a></span> highest degree. As a wintry
evening drew on, the wide, deep fireplace&#8212;equalling in width nearly
the whole of one side of the room, and so deep that benches were
permanently attached to the jambs, on which two or more could
comfortably sit&#8212;was duly prepared. A huge log, of a diameter equal to
that of &quot;the mast of some great admiral,&quot; six feet perhaps in length,
was worked in by handspikes to its place as the &quot;back-log;&quot; a smaller
one, as &quot;back-stick,&quot; placed over it; the great andirons duly
adjusted, and the wood piled on artistically&#8212;for there was an art in
building a wood-fire. The kindlings were placed on top of the whole;
never by an experienced hand below. More than the light of day, from
dazzling chandeliers or the magic tongues of flaming gas-burners,
blazes through the halls of modern luxury and splendor; but the lights
and shadows from a glowing, old-fashioned, New-England country
fireplace created a scene as enlivening, exhilarating, and genial as
has ever been witnessed, and cannot be surpassed. Assembled neighbors
in a single evening accomplished what would have been the work of a
family for months. The corn and the nuts were all shelled; the young
birch was stripped down in thin strands, and brooms enough made for a
year's service in house and barn; and various other useful offices
rendered. The sound of busy hands and nimble fingers was lost in
commingling happy voices. Fun and jest, joy and love, ruled the hour.
The whole affair was followed by &quot;Blind-man's Buff&quot; or some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[i.203]</a></span> other
sport. After the &quot;old folks&quot; had considerately retired, who knows but
that the sons and daughters of Puritans sometimes wound up with a
dance? There were sleigh-rides, and the woods rang with the happy
laugh and jingling bells. The vehicles used on these occasions were,
prior to 1700, more properly called &quot;sleds.&quot; Our modern &quot;sleigh&quot; had
not then been introduced. As the spring came on, logs would be
hollowed or scooped out and placed near the feet of sugar maples, a
slanting incision made a foot or two above them in the trunks of the
trees, a slip of shingle inserted, and the delicious sap would trickle
down into the troughs. When the proper time came, tents or booths made
of evergreen boughs would be erected in the woods, great kettles hung
over blazing fires, and a whole neighborhood camp out for several days
and nights, until the work was accomplished, and the flavory syrup or
solid cakes of sugar brought out.</p>

<p>These were some of the recreations of the country people in the early
settlements of New England; continuing, perhaps, in frontier towns to
this day. They constituted forms of enjoyment which cannot exist in
cities or older communities; and possessed a charm, in the memory of
all who ever participated in them, greater, far greater, than society
in any later stage can possess.</p>

<p>The principal method of travelling in those days was on horseback. It
afforded many special opportunities for social enjoyment. Women as
well as men were trained to it. The people of the village were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[i.204]</a></span> at
home in the saddle. The daughters of Joseph Putnam, sisters of Israel,
were celebrated as equestrians. Tradition relates adventurous feats of
theirs in this line, equal to that which constitutes a part of the
history of their famous brother. There were, perhaps, several games of
skill or chance practised more or less, even in those days, in this
neighborhood. The only one that seems to have been openly allowed, of
which we have any evidence, was shovel-board. This game, now supposed
to be out of use, is referred to by Shakespeare, and was quite common
in England as well as in this country. A board about two and a half
feet wide and twenty feet long was placed three feet above the floor,
somewhat like a billiard-table, though not with so wide a surface,
precisely level and perfectly smooth, covered with a sprinkling of
fine sand. It was provided with weights or balls, called &quot;pieces,&quot;
flattened on one end. The game consisted in shoving them as far as
possible, without going over the end. A trough surrounded the table to
catch the pieces if they fell. Richard Grant White, from whom this
account of the game has been derived, says that &quot;it required great
accuracy of eye, and steadiness of hand, much more than ten-pins.&quot; He
states that, when a boy, he saw it played by &quot;brawny&quot; men, in
Brooklyn, N.Y., and that the pieces then used were of brass. It is
probable that the &quot;pieces&quot; used on Bridget Bishop's shovel-board were
made of some heavy wood, as they were thrown into the fire for the
purpose of destroying them. The fact that a game like this was
suffered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[i.205]</a></span> be openly played in Salem Village is quite remarkable,
and shows that some license was left for such amusements.</p>

<p>The records and files of the local courts show, that, notwithstanding
the austere gravity and strictness of manners and morals usually
ascribed to our New-England ancestors, occasional irregularities
occurred in the early settlements, which would be considered high
misdemeanors in our day. The following deposition was given &quot;on oath
before the Court,&quot; Feb. 26, 1651. Edward Norris was the son of the
minister of the First Church; had been for more than ten years, and
continued to be for twenty years after, schoolmaster of the town; and,
by his character as well as office, commanded the highest respect.
John Kitchen, in 1655, was chosen &quot;searcher and sealer of leather.&quot;
Giles Corey had not yet purchased his farm, but lived on his town-lot,
extending from Essex Street, near its western extremity, to the North
River. They were severally persons of good estate.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;<span class="smcap">The Testimony of Giles Corey.</span>&#8212;Mr. Edward Norris
and I were going towards the brickkiln: John Kitchen, going
with us, fell a nipping and pinching of us. And, when we
came back again, John Kitchen struck up Mr. Edward Norris
his heels and mine, and fell upon me, and catched me by the
throat, and held me so long till he had almost stopped my
breath. And I said unto John Kitchen, 'This is not good
jesting.' And John Kitchen replied, 'This is nothing: I do
owe you more than this of old: this is not half of that
which you shall have afterwards.' After this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[i.206]</a></span> he went into
his house, and he took stinking water and threw upon us, and
took me and thrust me out of doors, and I went my ways. And
John Kitchen followed me half-way up the lane, or
thereabouts. Perceiving him to follow me, I went to go over
the rails. He took me again, and threw me down off the
rails, and fell a beating of me until I was all bloody. And,
Thomas Bishop being present, I desired him to bear witness
of what he saw. Upon my words, he let me rise. As soon as I
was up, he fell a beating of me again.</p>

<p>&quot;Testified on oath before the Court, 26th Feb., 1651.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Henry Bartholomew</span>, <i>Clerk</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<p>This was indeed an extraordinary outburst of lawless violence, and
gives a singular insight of the state of society. Such an occurrence
in our day would create astonishment. The organized power of the
community to suppress vicious and rude passions was probably never
brought to bear with greater rigidness than in our Puritan villages;
but it did not fully accomplish its end. Behind and beneath the solemn
and formal exterior, there was, after all, perhaps as much
irregularity of life as now. The nature of man had not been subdued.
The people had their quarrels and fights, and their frolics and
merriments, in defiance of the restraints of authority. Violations of
local and general laws were not infrequent; and flowed, as ever since,
from intemperance, in as large a measure. Kitchen, in this instance,
acted as if under the influence of liquor. His behavior, in tripping
up the heels and throwing dirty water upon the person of the
school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[i.207]</a></span>master of the town, the dignity of whose social position is
indicated by the title of &quot;Mr.;&quot; and in giving to Corey such a
persistent and gratuitous pommelling,&#8212;bears the aspect of a drunken
delirium. The latter seems not to have supposed, for some time, that
he was in earnest, but to have looked upon his conduct as rough play,
which was carried rather too far. Poor Corey was often getting before
the town Court as accused or accuser. He was, to the end, the victim
of ill-usage, either given or taken. Though not a bad-natured man, he
was almost always in trouble. The tenor of his long life was as
eccentric and unruly as the manner of his death was strange and
horrible.</p>

<p>There was what may be called an institution in the rural parishes of
the early times, still existing to some extent perhaps in country
places, which must not be omitted in an enumeration of controlling
influences. The people lived on farms, at some distance from each
other, and almost all at great distances from the meeting-house. Local
and parental authority, church discipline, public opinion, enforced
attendance upon the regular religious services. Fashion, habit, and
choice concurred in bringing all to meeting on the Lord's Day. It was
impossible for many to return home during the intermission between the
services of the forenoon and afternoon. The effect was, that the whole
community were thrown and kept together every week for several hours,
during which they could not avoid social intercourse. It was a more
effective institution than the town-meeting; for it occurred oftener,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[i.208]</a></span> included women and children. In pleasant weather, they would
perhaps gather together in knots at eligible places, or stroll off in
companies to the shades of the neighboring woods. In bad weather, they
would remain in the meeting-house, or congregate at Deacon Ingersoll's
ordinary, or in the great rooms of his dwelling-house. As a whole,
this practice must have produced important results upon the character
of the people. In the absence of newspapers, or of much intercourse
with remote places, the day was made the occasion for hearing and
telling all the news. It provided for the circulation of ideas, good
and bad. It widened the sphere of influence of the wiser and better
sort, and gave opportunity for mischievous people to do much harm. It
was a sort of central bazaar, open every week, where all the varieties
of local gossip could be interchanged and circulated far and wide. Of
the aggregate character of the effects thus produced, I do not propose
to strike the balance. It was undoubtedly an effective instrumentality
in moulding the population of the country, developing the elements of
society, quickening and rendering more vigorous the action of the
people in masses, and elucidating the phenomena of their history. It
answers my purpose, at present, to suggest, that, if any popular
delusion or fanaticism arose, the means of giving it a rapid
diffusion, and of intensifying its power, were in this way provided.</p>

<p>In the early settlement of the country, the pursuit of game in the
forests, rivers, and lakes, was necessary as a means of subsistence,
and has always been im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[i.209]</a></span>portant in that view. A war against beasts and
birds of prey was also required to be incessantly kept up. The methods
adopted for these ends were various and ingenious, often requiring
courage and skill, and in most instances conducted in companies. Deer
and moose were sometimes caged by surrounding them, or trapped; but
the gun was chiefly relied upon in their pursuit. There were various
methods for catching the smaller animals. One of the sports of boyhood
was to spring the rabbits or hares. A sapling, or young tree, was bent
down and fastened to a stick slid into notches cut in trees, on each
side of the path of the animal. The rabbit is wont to race through the
woods at great speed, and along established tracks, which,
particularly after snow has fallen, are clearly traceable. To the
cross-stick, thus placed above the path, one end of a strong
horse-hair was tied. The other end was in a slip-knot, with a noose
just large enough, and hanging at the height, to receive the head of
the rabbit. Not seeing the noose, and rushing along the path, the
rabbit would jerk the cross-stick out of the notches. The tree would
bound back to its original upright direction, and the rabbit remain
swinging aloft, until, at the break of day, the boys would rejoice in
the success of their stratagem. Pigeons in clouds frequented the
country in their seasons, and acres upon acres of the forests bowed
beneath their weight. They were taken by nets, dozens at a time, or
brought down in great numbers by shot-guns. The marshalled hosts of
wild geese made their noisy flights over the land in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[i.210]</a></span> spring and
fall, traversing a space spanning the continent north and south. They
were brought down by the gun, on the wing, or surprised while resting
in their long route or stopped by storms, around secluded ponds or
swamps. Ducks and other aquatic birds were abundant on the rivers and
marshes, and pursued in canoes along the bays and seashores.
Salt-water fish were within reach in the neighboring ocean; while an
unfailing supply of fresh-water fish was yielded by Wenham Lake,
Wilkins's Pond, and the running streams.</p>

<p>The bear was a formidable prowler around the settlements, killing
young cattle, making havoc in the sheepfold, and depredating upon the
barn and farm yard. He was a dangerous antagonist, of immense strength
in his arms and claws. Sometimes he was reached effectually by the
gun, but the trap was mainly relied upon to secure him. His skin made
him a valuable prize, and he supplied other beneficial uses. The
earliest and rudest method of trapping a bear was as follows: A place
was selected in the woods, where two large fallen and mouldering trees
were side by side within two or three feet of each other. The space
between them would be roofed over by throwing branches and boughs
across them, and closed up at one end. The other end would be left
open. A gun was placed inside, heavily loaded, the muzzle towards the
open end; to the trigger a cord was fastened running along by the
barrel of the gun, passing over a cross-bar, and hanging down directly
before the muzzle, baited with a piece of fresh meat. The bear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[i.211]</a></span>
ranging in the woods at night, would be attracted by the smell of
meat, and come snuffing around. At the open end, he would see the
bait, rush in, seize it between his jaws, pull the cord, discharge the
gun, and his head and breast be torn to pieces. The men engaged in the
enterprise would remain awake in some neighboring house, waiting and
listening, with the extremest interest, for the report of the gun to
announce their success. At the break of day, they would gather to the
spot, and participate in the profit of the capture. After a while,
iron or steel traps were introduced. They would be skilfully baited
and set, and fastened to a tree by a chain. The whole was covered over
with light soil and leaves. The bear would make for the bait. The
weight of his paw would spring the trap. The iron-teeth would hold him
fast till the morning. In his suffering and exasperation, it would
require considerable effort to despatch him. In catching bears, as
well as foxes, much skill and art were needed. They were each very
wary and cautious; and, where iron was used in the traps, some scent
was necessary to disguise the smell of the metal. All appearance of
having been disturbed had to be removed from the ground. Trapping
became quite a science, and was a pursuit of much importance.</p>

<p>Wolves were perhaps the most destructive of the beasts of prey.
Although not so large or strong as bears, they were far more fierce
and rapacious. Bears could be tamed, but wolves not. Bears were not
dangerous, unless provoked, or suffering from hunger, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[i.212]</a></span> alarmed for
the safety of their young. It was thought that kind treatment would
awaken strong attachment in them, but wolves were always snarling and
ferocious. They roamed mostly in packs, and would kill sheep, lambs,
and poultry long after hunger was appeased. The farmers regarded them
as their great enemy. A long and deep trench would be dug, lined with
slippery logs, from which the bark had been taken, standing upright,
and touching each other. The trench was covered by a slight framework,
upon which leaves and dirt were scattered, to make the surface appear
like the surrounding territory. Some savory bait would be placed over
it. The wolves, rushing on, would break through. Not being able to
ascend the sides, they would be found alive, the next morning, at the
bottom. These were called &quot;wolf-pits.&quot; It was no easy matter to
dispose of or despatch the furious animals, and the wolf-pits were
often the scenes of much excitement. There was another class of
animals,&#8212;divided into different species, mostly according to their
size,&#8212;smaller but fiercer than wolves, of extraordinary strength and
activity, called wild-cats, catamounts, or loup-cerviers, pronounced
by the farmers lucifees. These were only taken by the gun. It was
considered a useful public service, and no inconsiderable feat, to
kill them.</p>

<p>Some of the laborious employments, at that time, were especially
promotive of social influence; for instance, the making and mending
highways. This was secured by a tax, annually levied in town-meeting.
The work was placed under the care and direction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[i.213]</a></span> surveyors,
annually chosen. A small part of this tax, however, was paid in money.
Most of it was &quot;worked out.&quot; At convenient seasons, when there was a
respite from the ordinary farm work, the men of a neighborhood would
come together, in greater or less numbers, at a designated time and
place, with their oxen and implements. Working in unison, they would
work merrily and with energy; and, as the tough roots and deeply
bedded rocks gave way to the pickaxe, crowbar, and chain, and rough
places became smooth, the wilderness would echo back their voices of
gratulation, and a spirit of animating rivalry stimulate their toils.
Many other operations were carried on, such as getting up hay from the
salt-marshes and building stone-walls, by neighbors working in
companies.</p>

<p>Particular circumstances in the history of the population of Salem
Village contributed to keep up a condition of general intelligence,
which served, to some degree, as a substitute for an organized system
of education. Indeed, any thing like regular schools was rendered
impossible by the then-existing circumstances. Clearings had made a
very inconsiderable encroachment on the wilderness. There were here
and there farmhouses, with deep forests between. It was long before
easily traversable roads could be made. A schoolhouse placed
permanently on any particular spot would be within the reach of but
very few. Farmers most competent to the work, who had enjoyed the
advantages of some degree of education, and could manage to set apart
any time for the pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[i.214]</a></span>pose, were, in some instances, prevailed upon to
receive such children as were within reaching distance as pupils in
their own houses, to be instructed by them at stated times and for a
limited period. Daniel Andrew rendered this service occasionally. At
one period, we find them practising the plan of a movable school and
schoolmaster. He would be stationed in the houses of particular
persons, with whom the arrangement could be made, a month at a time,
in the different quarters of the village, from Will's Hill to Bass
River. Of course, there was a great lack of elementary education. For
a considerable time, it was reduced to a very low point; and there
were heads of families,&#8212;men who had good farms, and possessed the
confidence and respect of their neighbors,&#8212;who appear not to have
been able to write.</p>

<p>It is difficult, however, to come to a definite estimate on this
subject, as the singular fact is discovered, that some persons, who
could write, occasionally preferred to &quot;make their mark.&quot; Ann Putnam,
in executing her will, made her mark; but her confession, with her own
proper written signature, is spread out in the Church-book. Francis
Nurse very frequently used his peculiar mark, representing, perhaps,
some implement of his original mechanical trade; but, on other
occasions, he wrote out his name in a good, round hand. The same was
the case with Bray Wilkins. We can hardly reach any decisive
conclusions as to the intelligence or education of the people of that
day from their handwriting, or construction of sentences, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[i.215]</a></span> less
from their spelling. Their forms of speech were very different from
ours in many respects. What, at first view, we might be apt to call
errors of ignorance, were perhaps conformity to good usage at the
time. Their use of verbs is different from ours, particularly in the
subjunctive mood, and in conjugation generally. They did not follow
our rule in reference to number. When the nominative was a plural
noun, or several nouns, they often employ the connected verb in the
singular number, and <i>vice vers&#226;</i>. They were inclined to make
construction conform to the sense, rather than to the letter. It is
not certain that their usage, in this particular, is wholly
indefensible. Cicero, in his fifth oration against Verres, couples
<i>rem</i> with <i>futurum</i>. This was looked upon by some editors as an
error, and they altered the text accordingly; but Aulus Gelius, in his
&quot;Attic Nights,&quot; maintains that it is the true reading, and, in view of
the sense of the passage, a legitimate and elegant use of language. He
cites instances, in Latin and Greek authors of the highest standard,
of a similar usage.</p>

<p>Nothing, or scarcely any thing, can be inferred from spelling. It was
wholly unsettled among the best-educated men, and in the practice of
the same person. In Winthrop's &quot;Journal,&quot; he spells the name of his
distinguished friend&#8212;the governor of both Massachusetts and
Connecticut&#8212;sometimes Haynes, and sometimes Haines. The <i>r</i> is
generally dropped from his own signature, or, if not intentionally
dropped, is quite lost in one or the other of the contiguous let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[i.216]</a></span>ters.
It is a curious circumstance, that the name &quot;Winthrop&quot; is spelled
differently by our governor, his wife, and his son, the governor of
Connecticut; each varying from either of the other two. George
Burroughs, a graduate of Harvard College, wrote his own name sometimes
with, and sometimes without, the <i>s</i>. In our General-court records,
the name of the first Captain Davenport is spelled in at least four
different ways. The Putnams sometimes wrote their name Putman. The
name of the Nurses was often written Nourse, and sometimes Nurs.</p>

<p>Unable to come to any reliable conclusions in reference to the general
intelligence of the people of Salem Village from their orthography,
etymology, syntax, or chirography, compared with their contemporaries,
I can only say, that, in examining the records and papers which have
come down to us, the wonder to me is that they expressed themselves so
well. I do not hesitate to say, that, in the various controversies in
which they were involved, prior to and immediately after the
witchcraft delusion, there is a pervading appearance of uncommon
appreciation of the questions at issue, and substantial evidence that
there was a solid substratum of good sense among them.</p>

<p>Their manners appear to have been remarkably courteous and respectful,
showing the effect still remaining upon their style of intercourse and
personal bearing, of the society and example of the great number of
eminent, enlightened, and accomplished men and families that had
resided or mingled with them during all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[i.217]</a></span> the early period of their
history. In their deportment to each other, there was that sort of
decorum which indicates good breeding. They paid honor to gray hairs,
and assigned to age the first rank in seating the congregation,&#8212;a
matter to which, before the introduction of pews as a particular
property, they gave the greatest consideration. The &quot;seating&quot; was to
continue for a year; and a committee of persons who would command the
greatest confidence was regularly appointed to report on the delicate
and difficult subject. Their report, signed by them severally, was
entered in full in the parish record-book. The invariable rule was,
first, age; then, office; last, rates. The chief seats were given to
old men and women of respectable characters, without regard to their
circumstances in life or position in society. Then came the families
of the minister and deacons, the parish committee and clerk, the
constable of the village, magistrates, and military officers. These
were preferred, because all offices were then honorable, and held, if
they were called to them, by the principal people. Last came
rates,&#8212;that is, property. The richest man in the parish, if not
holding office, or old enough to be counted among the aged, would take
his place with the residue of the congregation. The manner in which
parents were spoken of on all occasions is quite observable, not only
in written documents, but ordinary conversation,&#8212;always with tender
respectfulness. In almost all cases, the expressions used are &quot;my
honored father&quot; or &quot;my honored mother,&quot; and this by per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[i.218]</a></span>sons in the
humblest and most inferior positions in life. The terms &quot;Goodman&quot; and
&quot;Goodwife&quot; were applied to the heads of families. The latter word was
abbreviated to &quot;Goody,&quot; but not at all, as our dictionaries have it,
as a &quot;low term of civility.&quot; It was applied to the most honored
matrons, such as the wife of Deacon Ingersoll. It was a term of
respect; conveying, perhaps, an affectionate sentiment, but not in the
slightest degree disrespectful, derogatory, or belittling. Surely no
better terms were ever used to characterize a worthy person. &quot;Goodman&quot;
comprehends all that can be ascribed to a citizen of mature years in
the way of commendation; and the whole catalogue of pretentious titles
ever given by flatterers or courtiers to a married lady cannot, all
combined, convey a higher encomium than the term &quot;Goodwife.&quot; How much
more expressive, courteous to the persons to whom they are applied,
and consistent with the self-respect of the person using them, than
&quot;Mr.&quot; and &quot;Mrs.&quot;! A more than questionable taste and a foolish pride
have led us to adopt these terms because they were originally
applicable to the gentry or to magistrates, and to abandon the good
old words which had a meaning truly polite to others, and not
degrading to ourselves!</p>

<p>A patriarchal authority and dignity was recognized in families. The
oldest member was often called, by way of distinction, &quot;Landlord,&quot;
merely on account of his seniority, without reference particularly to
the extent of his domain or the value of his acres. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[i.219]</a></span> the death
of Thomas Putnam, in 1686, his brother Nathaniel had the title; after
him, the surviving brother, Captain John; after him, it fell to the
next generation, and Benjamin, a son of Nathaniel, became &quot;Landlord
Putnam.&quot; It was so with other families.</p>

<p>The liberal and judicious policy, before described, of giving estates
to children on their marriage, with the maintenance of parental
authority in the household, produced the desired effect upon the
character of the people. It was almost a matter of course, that, on
reaching mature years, young men and women would own the covenant, and
become members of the church. The general tone of society was
undoubtedly favorable to the moral and religious welfare of the
younger portion of the community. Some exceptions occurred, but few in
number. One case, however, in which there was a flagrant violation of
filial duty, may not be omitted in this connection; for it belongs to
the public history of the country.</p>

<p>John Porter, Jr., the eldest son of the founder of that most
respectable family, about thirty years of age, appears to have been a
very wicked and incorrigible person. His abusive treatment of his
parents reached a point where it became necessary, in the last resort,
to appeal to the protection of the law. After various proceedings, he
was finally sentenced to stand on the ladder of the gallows with a
rope around his neck for an hour; to be severely whipped; committed to
the House of Correction; kept closely at work on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[i.220]</a></span> prison diet, not to
be released until so ordered by the Court of Assistants or the General
Court; and to pay &quot;a fine to the country of two hundred pounds.&quot; It is
stated, that, if the mother of the culprit &quot;had not been overmoved by
her tender affections to forbear appearing against him, the Court must
necessarily have proceeded with him as a capital offender, according
to our law being grounded upon and expressed in the Word of God, in
Deut. xxi. 18 to 21. See Capital Laws, p. 9, &#167; 14.&quot; Some time
afterward, the General Court, upon his petition, granted him a release
from imprisonment, on condition of his immediate departure from this
jurisdiction; first giving a bond of two hundred pounds not to return
without leave of the General Court or Court of Assistants.</p>

<p>In 1664, four commissioners, Colonel Richard Nichols, Sir Robert Carr,
George Cartwright, and Samuel Maverick, Esqs., were sent over by
Charles II. &quot;to hear and determine complaints and appeals in all
causes, as well military as criminal and civil.&quot; There had always been
a powerful influence at work in the English Court adverse to New
England. It had been thus far successfully baffled by the admirable
diplomacy of the colonial government and agents. All conflicts of
authority had been prevented from coming to a head by a skilful policy
of &quot;protracting and avoiding.&quot; But the restoration of the Stuarts
boded no good to the liberties of the colonies; and the arrival of
these commissioners with their sweeping authority was regarded as
designed to deal the long-deferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[i.221]</a></span> fatal blow at chartered rights.
They began with a high hand. The General Court did not quail before
them, but stood ready to take advantage of the first false step of the
commissioners; and they did not have long to wait.</p>

<p>Porter had taken refuge in Rhode Island. When the commissioners
visited that colony, he appealed to them for redress against the
Massachusetts General Court. They were inconsiderate enough to espouse
his cause, and issued a proclamation giving him protection to return
to Boston to have his case tried before them. The General Court at
once took issue with them, and changed their attitude from the
defensive to the offensive; denounced their proceedings; spread upon
the official records a full account, in the plainest language, of
Porter's outrages upon his parents, exhibiting it in details that
could not but shock every sentiment of humanity and decency; holding
up the commissioners as the abettors and protectors of criminality of
the deepest dye; and planting themselves fair and square against them
on the merits of Porter's case. The commissioners tried to explain and
extricate themselves; but they could not escape from the toils in
which, through rashness, they had become entangled. The General Court
made a public declaration charging the commissioners with &quot;obstructing
the sentence of justice passed against that notorious offender,&quot; and
with sheltering and countenancing &quot;his rebellion against his natural
parents;&quot; with violating a court of justice, discharging a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[i.222]</a></span>
country &quot;from their oaths whereby they had sworn obedience to His
Majesty's authority according to the Constitution of his Royal
Charter;&quot; and with attempting to overthrow the rights of the colony
under the charter by bringing in a military force to overawe and
suppress the civil authorities. They denounced them as guilty of a
perversion of their trust, and as having committed a breach upon the
dignity of the crown, by pursuing a course &quot;derogatory to His
Majesty's authority here established,&quot; and &quot;repugnant to His Majesty's
princely and gracious intention in betrusting them with such a
commission.&quot; The Court held the vantage-ground, and the commissioners
were unable to dislodge them. The end of the matter was, that the
power of the commissioners was completely broken down. They
ingloriously gave up the contest, and went home to England.</p>

<p>The instance of John Porter, Jr., to which such extraordinary
publicity and prominence were given by the circumstances now related,
does not bear against what I have said of the general prevalence, in
the rural community of Salem Village, of parental authority and filial
duty, as he was early withdrawn from it to pursuits that led him into
totally different spheres of life. He had been engaged in trade, and
exposed to vicious influences in foreign ports. In voyages to
&quot;Barbadoes, and so for England, he had prodigally wasted and riotously
expended about four hundred pounds.&quot; Besides this, he had run himself,
by his vicious courses, into debts which his father had to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[i.223]</a></span> in
order to release him from prison abroad. He came back the desperate
character described by the General Court. His punishment was severe,
but absolutely necessary, in the judgment of the whole community, for
the safety of his parents and the preservation of domestic and public
order.</p>

<p>Although living in humble dwellings on plain fare, working with their
hands for daily bread, clad in rude garments, and practising a frugal
economy, there was a certain style of things about the people I am
describing unlike what is ordinarily associated with our ideas of
them. The men wore swords or rapiers as a part of their daily apparel.
Their wives had domestic servants. Every farmer had his hired
laborers, and many of them had slaves. The relation of servitude,
however, differed from that on Southern plantations in many respects.
The slaves, without any formal manumission, easily obtained their
freedom, and often became landholders. The courteous decorum acquired
from the example of the eminent men among the first planters long
continued to mark the manners of this people; and its vestiges remain
to the present day. It strikingly appeared in the latter half of the
last and the earlier period of this century in the persons of Judge
Samuel Houlton, Colonel Israel Hutchinson, General Moses Porter, and
the late Judge Samuel Putnam.</p>

<p>The wise forethought of the company in London, at the outset of its
operations, in providing for all that was needful to the establishment
and welfare of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[i.224]</a></span> colony, has already been described. It was most
strikingly illustrated in the careful selection of the first
emigrants. Men were sought out who were experienced and skilful in the
various mechanic arts. In the early population of Salem Farms, every
species of handicraft was represented. When the number was less than a
hundred householders, there were weavers, spinners, potters, joiners,
housewrights, wheelwrights, brickmakers and masons, blacksmiths,
coopers, painters, tailors, cordwainers, glovers, tanners, millers,
maltsters, skinners, sawyers, tray-makers, and dish-turners. Every
absolute want was provided for. These trades and callings were carried
on in connection with agricultural employments, and their continuance
kept carefully in view by the heads of the principal families. John
Putnam not only gave large farms to each of his sons, but he trained
them severally to some mechanical art. One was a weaver, another a
bricklayer, &amp;c. The farmer was also a mechanic, and every description
of useful labor held in equal honor.</p>

<p>Another marked feature of this people was their military spirit. They
were kept in a state of universal and thorough organization to protect
themselves from Indian hostilities, or to respond, on any occasion, at
a moment's warning, to the call of the country. The sentinel at the
watch-house was ever on the alert. Authority was early obtained from
the General Court to form a foot company. All adults of every
description, including men much beyond middle life,&#8212;every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[i.225]</a></span> one, in
fact, who could carry a musket, belonged to it. Its officers were the
fathers of the village. Every title of rank, from corporal to captain,
once obtained, was worn ever after through life. Jonathan Walcot, a
citizen of the highest respectability, who had married as a second
wife Deliverance a daughter of Thomas Putnam, and was one of the
deacons of the parish, was its captain. Nathaniel Ingersoll, the other
deacon, is spoken of from time to time as corporal, then sergeant, and
finally lieutenant. He served with that commission till late in life,
and was always, after attaining that rank, known as either Lieutenant
or Deacon Ingersoll. The eldest son of Thomas Putnam, a leading member
of the church, a man of large property, and the clerk of the parish,
was one of the sergeants, always known as such. In our narrative, with
which he will be found in most unfortunate connection, I shall speak
of him by that title. It will distinguish him from his father. This
&quot;company&quot; had frequent drills, probably from the first, in the field
left by will afterwards for that purpose by Nathaniel Ingersoll.
Often, no doubt, it paraded on the open grounds around the
meeting-house, or in the fields of Joseph Hutchinson after the harvest
had been gathered. It marched and countermarched along the neighboring
roads. It was almost as much thought of as the &quot;church,&quot; officered by
the same persons, and composed of the same men. It was a common
practice, at the close of a parade, before &quot;breaking line,&quot; for the
captain to give notices of prayer, church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[i.226]</a></span> or parish meetings. Such
men as Richard Leach, Thomas Fuller, and Nathaniel Putnam, esteemed it
an honor to bear titles in this company; and held them ever after
through life with pride, whether corporal, sergeant, lieutenant, or
captain.</p>

<p>A company of troopers was early formed, made up from the village and
neighboring settlements. In the colonial records, under date of Oct.
8, 1662, we find the following: &quot;Mr. George Corwin for captain, Mr.
Thomas Putnam for lieutenant, Mr. Walter Price for cornet, being
presented to this Court as so chosen by the troopers of Salem, Lynn,
&amp;c., the Court allows and approves thereof.&quot; The inventory of Captain
Corwin, before cited, indicates the stylish uniform he wore as captain
of the troopers. Each of the officers was a wealthy man; and it cannot
be doubted that a parade of the company was a dashing affair. The
lapse of time having thinned their ranks and removed their officers, a
vigorous and successful attempt was made in October, 1678, to revive
the company. Thirty-six men, belonging, as they say, &quot;to the reserve
of Salem old troop,&quot; and very desirous &quot;of being serviceable to God
and the country,&quot; petition the General Court to re-organize them as a
troop of horse, and to issue the necessary commissions. They request
the appointment of William Brown, Jr., as captain, and Corporal John
Putnam as lieutenant. The petition was granted, and the commissions
issued. Among the signers of this petition are Anthony Needham, Peter
and Ezekiel Cheever, Thomas Flint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[i.227]</a></span> Thomas and Benjamin Wilkins,
Thomas and Jacob Fuller, John Procter, William Osborne, Thomas Putnam,
Jr., and others of the Farms. The officers named were men of property
and energy; and the company of troopers was kept up ever afterwards,
until all danger from Indians or other foes had passed away.</p>

<p>It is very observable how the military spirit with which this rural
community was so early imbued has descended through all generations.
Israel Putnam, the famous Revolutionary hero, a son of Joseph who was
a younger brother of Sergeant Thomas and Deacon Edward Putnam, was
born in the village. His brother David, much older than himself, who
flourished in the period anterior to the Revolution, was a celebrated
cavalry officer. Colonel Timothy Pickering used to mention, among the
recollections of his boyhood, that David Putnam &quot;rode the best horse
in the province.&quot; General Rufus Putnam, a grandson of Deacon Edward,
was a distinguished brigadier in the army of the Revolution. There are
few officers of that army whose names are more honored than his by
encomiums from the pen of Washington: and praise from him was praise
indeed, for it was, like all his other judgments, the result of
careful and discriminating observation. In a letter to the President
of Congress, dated &quot;At camp above Trenton Falls, Dec. 20, 1776,&quot; he
speaks of the fact, that, owing to a neglect on the part of the
Government to place the Engineer Department upon a proper footing,
&quot;Colo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[i.228]</a></span>nel Putnam, who was at the head of it, has quitted, and taken a
regiment in the State of Massachusetts.&quot; He expresses the opinion,
that Putnam's qualifications as a military engineer were superior to
those of any other man within his knowledge, far superior to those of
the foreign officers whom he had seen. In a letter to the same, dated
&quot;Pompton Plains,&quot; July 12, 1777, speaking of General Schuyler's army,
he says, &quot;Colonel Putnam, I imagine, will be with him before this, as
his regiment is a part of Nixon's Brigade, who will answer every
purpose he can possibly have for an engineer at this crisis.&quot; The high
opinion of Washington took effect in his promotion as
brigadier-general. At the end of the war, he returned to civil life,
but was soon called back and re-commissioned as brigadier-general.
Washington felt the need of him. In a letter to General Knox,
Secretary of War, dated Aug. 13, 1792, he says, &quot;General Putnam merits
thanks, in my opinion, for his plan, and the sentiments he has
delivered on what he conceives to be a proper mode of carrying on the
war against the hostile nations of Indians; and I wish he would
continue to furnish them without reserve in future.&quot; During
Washington's administration of the government under the Constitution,
Rufus Putnam held the office of Surveyor-General of the United States.
In addition to his military reputation, he will be for ever memorable
as the first settler of Marietta, and founder of the State of Ohio.</p>

<p>Israel Hutchinson was born in 1727. In 1757 he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[i.229]</a></span> was one of a
scouting-party under the command of his neighbor, Captain Israel
Herrick, that penetrated through the wilderness in Maine in perilous
Indian warfare. He fought at Ticonderoga and Lake George, and was with
Wolfe when he scaled the Heights of Abraham. On the morning of the
19th of April, 1775, he led a company of minute-men, who met and
fought the British in their bloody retreat from Lexington. He was
prominently concerned during the siege of Boston; and, on its
evacuation, took command at Fort Hill. He was afterwards in command at
Forts Lee and Washington. Throughout the war, he, like both the
Putnams, had the confidence of his commander-in-chief. For twenty-one
years, he was elected to one or the other branch of the Legislature,
or to the Council. He was distinguished for the courtesy of his
manners and the dignity of his address. Colonel Enoch Putnam was also
at the battle of Lexington, and served with honor through the
Revolutionary War, as did also Captain Jeremiah Putnam, both of them
descendants of John. Captain Samuel Flint was among the bravest of the
brave at Lexington, exciting universal admiration by his intrepidity;
and fell at the head of his company at Stillwater, Oct. 7, 1777.</p>

<p>Intelligence of the marching of the British towards Lexington, on the
19th of April, 1775, reached the lower part of Danvers about nine
o'clock that morning. With a rapidity that is perfectly marvellous,
when we consider the distances from each other over which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[i.230]</a></span>
inhabitants were scattered, five companies, fully organized and
equipped,&#8212;each of them containing men of the village,&#8212;rushed to the
field in time to meet the retreating enemy at West Cambridge. It was a
rally and a march without precedent, and never yet surpassed. The day
was extremely sultry for the season; and the distance traversed by
many of the men from the village, before they got into that fight,
could not have been less than twenty miles. Seven belonging to Danvers
companies were killed, and others wounded. A larger offering was made
that day at the baptismal sacrifice to American liberty by Danvers
than by any other town except Lexington; and no town represented in
the scene was more remote. Of the men who fell on this occasion, the
following appear to have been of the village: Samuel Cook, Benjamin
Daland, and Perley Putnam,&#8212;the last a descendant of John. Their
bodies were brought home, and buried with appropriate honors; two
companies from Salem, and military detachments from Newburyport,
Amesbury, and Salisbury participating in the ceremonies, and giving
the soldier's tribute to their glory, by volleys over their closing
graves.</p>

<p>Moses Porter, when eighteen years of age, attracted attention by his
heroic courage and indomitable pluck at Bunker Hill. He was in an
artillery company, and would not quit his gun when almost every other
man had fallen. His country never allowed him to quit it afterwards.
From that day, he bore a commission in the army of the United States.
He was retained on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[i.231]</a></span> every peace establishment, always in the
artillery, and at the head of that arm of the service for a great
length of time, and until the day of his death. He was in the battle
of Brandywine, and wounded in a subsequent fight on the banks of the
Delaware. He was with Wayne in his campaign against the Western
Indians, and won his share of the glory that crowned it in the final
bloody and decisive conflict. He was at the head of the artillery when
the war of 1812 took place, in active service on the Niagara frontier,
and on the 10th of September, 1813, brevetted &quot;for distinguished
services.&quot; He commanded at Norfolk, in Virginia, in 1814, and received
great credit for the ability and vigilance with which he held that
most vital point of the coast defence. At successive periods after the
war, he was at the head of each of the geographical military divisions
of the country. He died at Cambridge, Mass., in 1822, while in command
of the Eastern Department, near the scene of his youthful glory,
forty-seven years before. No man who fought at Bunker Hill remained so
long a soldier of the United States. No man had so extended a record,
and it was bright with honor from the beginning to the end. His
pre-eminent reputation, as a disciplinarian and artillerist of the
highest class, was uniformly maintained. He added to the sterner
qualities required by professional duty a polished urbanity of
manners, and a dignified and commanding aspect and bearing. His ashes
rest beneath the sod of his ancestral acres in Salem Village.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[i.232]</a></span></p>

<p>When the great war for the suppression of the Southern Rebellion came
on, and the life of the Union was at stake, the same old spirit was
found unabated. A descendant of the family of Raymonds, emulating the
example of his ancestors, rallied his company to the front. At the end
of the war, Lieutenant-Colonel John W. Raymond brought back, in
command, the remnant of his veteran regiment, with its tattered
banners; two of his predecessors in that commission having fallen in
battle. The youthful patriot, William Lowell Putnam, who fell at
Ball's Bluff on the 21st of October, 1861, was a direct descendant of
Nathaniel Putnam. It is an interesting circumstance, that the names of
men who trained in the foot company and with the troopers on the
fields and roads about the village meeting-house two hundred years ago
have re-appeared in the persons of their descendants, in the highest
lines of service and with unsurpassed distinction, in the three great
wars of America,&#8212;Major-General Israel, and Brigadier-General Rufus,
Putnam, in the War of the Revolution; Brigadier-General Moses Porter,
in the War of 1812; and Major-General Granville M. Dodge, in the War
of the Rebellion. The last-named is a descendant of a hero of the
Narragansett fight, and was born and educated in Salem Village.</p>

<p>Several lawsuits, particularly in land cases, have been referred to.
They indicate, perhaps, to some extent the ingredients that aggravated
the terrible scenes we are preparing to contemplate. They served to
keep up the general intelligence of the community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[i.233]</a></span> through a period
necessarily destitute of such means of information as we enjoy.
Attendance upon courts of law, serving on juries, having to give
testimony at trials, are indeed in themselves no unimportant part in
the education of a people. Principles and questions of great moment
are forced upon general attention, and become topics of discussion in
places of gathering and at private firesides. Of this material of
intelligence, the people of the village had their full share. It was
their fate to have their minds, and more or less their passions,
stirred up by special local controversies thrust upon them. As a
religious society, they had difficult points of disagreement with the
mother-church, and the town of Salem. While they were supporting a
minister and trying to build a meeting-house for themselves, attempts
were made to tax them to support the minister and build a new
meeting-house in the town. There was a natural reluctance to part with
them, and it was long before an arrangement could be made. The great
distance of many of the farmers from the town prevented their
exercising what they deemed their rightful influence in municipal
affairs. They felt, that, in many respects, their interests were not
identical, and in some absolutely at variance. These topics were much
discussed, and with considerable feeling at times on both sides. The
papers which remain relating to the subject show that the farmers
understood it in all its bearings, and maintained their cause with
clearness of perception and forcibleness of argument and expression.
At one time, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[i.234]</a></span> very desirous to be set off as a distinct
town, but this could not be allowed; and, finally, a sort of
compromise was effected. A partial separation&#8212;a
semi-municipality&#8212;was agreed upon. Salem Village was the result.</p>

<p>In 1670, a petition, with twenty signers, was presented to the town to
be set off as a parish, and be allowed to provide a minister for
themselves. In March, 1672, the town granted the request; and, in
October following, the General Court approved of the project, and gave
it legal effect. The line agreed upon by the town and the village is
substantially defined by the vote of the former, which was as follows:
&quot;All farmers that now are, or hereafter shall be, willing to join
together for providing a minister among themselves, whose habitations
are above Ipswich Highway, from the horse bridge to the wooden bridge,
at the hither end of Mr. Endicott's Plain, and from thence on a west
line, shall have liberty to have a minister by themselves; and when
they shall provide and pay him in a maintenance, that then they shall
be discharged from their part of Salem ministers' maintenance,&quot; &amp;c.
The &quot;horse bridge&quot; was across Bass River. The &quot;wooden bridge&quot; was at
the head of Cow-House or Endicott River. Ipswich highway runs along
from one of these points to the other. The south line, beyond the
wooden bridge, is seen on the <a href="#map">map</a>. All to the north of this line, and
of Ipswich highway between the bridges, to the bounds of Beverly and
Wenham on the east; Topsfield, Rowley Village,&#8212;since Boxford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[i.235]</a></span> and
Andover on the north; and Reading and Lynn on the west,&#8212;was the
Village. Middleton, incorporated afterwards, absorbed a large part of
its western portion; but, at the time of the witchcraft delusion, the
Village was bounded as above described, and as in the <a href="#map">map</a>. There was a
specific arrangement fixing the point of time when the farmers were to
become exempt from all charges in aid of the mother-church; that is,
as soon as they had provided for the support of a minister and the
erection of a meeting-house of their own. It was further stipulated,
that the villagers should not form a church until a minister was
ordained; and that they should not settle a minister permanently
without the approval of the old church, and its consent to proceed to
an ordination. This latter restriction was perhaps the cause of all
the subsequent troubles.</p>

<p>Owing, as has been stated in another connection, to erroneous notions
about the topography of the country; the incompetency perhaps, in some
cases, of surveyors; and the want of due care in the General Court and
the towns to have boundaries clearly defined,&#8212;uncertainties and
conflicting claims arose in various portions of the colony, but
nowhere to a greater extent than here. The village became involved in
controversies about boundaries with each one of its neighbors;
producing, at times, much exasperation. The documents drawn forth on
these questions, as they appear in the record-book of the village, are
written with ability, and show that there were men among them who knew
how to express and enforce their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[i.236]</a></span> views. The plain, lucid,
well-considered style of Nathaniel Ingersoll's depositions on the
court-files, in numerous cases, render it not improbable that his pen
was put in requisition. Sergeant Thomas Putnam, the parish recorder,
as he was sometimes entitled, was a good writer. His chirography,
although not handsome, is singularly uniform, full, open, and clear,
so easily legible that it is a refreshment to meet with it; and his
sentences are well-constructed, simple, condensed, and to the purpose.
His words do their office in conveying his meaning. No public body
ever had a better clerk. Somehow or other, he and others, brought up
in the woods, had contrived to acquire considerable efficiency in the
use of the pen. Perhaps, a few who, like him, had parents able to
afford it, had been sent to Ipswich or Charlestown to enjoy the
privilege of what Cotton Mather calls &quot;the Cheverian education.&quot;</p>

<p>The southern boundary of the village was intended to run due west from
the Ipswich road to Lynn, and was accordingly spoken of as &quot;on a west
line.&quot; As originally established, it was defined by an enumeration of
a variety of objects such as trees of different kinds and sizes, as
running through the lands of John Felton, Nathaniel Putnam, and
Anthony Needham, to &quot;a dry stump standing at the corner of Widow
Pope's cow-pen, leaving her house and the saw-mill within the farmer's
range,&quot; and so on to &quot;the top of the hill by the highway side near
Berry Pond.&quot; From the changeable conditions of some of the objects,
and a diversity of methods adopted by surveyors,&#8212;many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[i.237]</a></span> of them being
unacquainted with, or making no allowance for, the variation of the
compass,&#8212;controversies arose with the mother-town: and some
proprietors, like the Gardners, were left in doubt how the line
affected them; and there was, in consequence, much disquietude. The
line was not accurately run until 1700.</p>

<p>It is observable, that the &quot;saw-mill&quot; is still in operation on the
same spot. The &quot;cow-pen,&quot; then on the south side of the mill, was,
more than a century ago, removed to the north side, where it has
remained ever since. This estate has interesting reminiscences. It was
an original grant in January, 1640, to Edward Norris, at the time of
his settlement as pastor of the First Church in Salem. He sold to
Eleanor Trussler in 1654. It then went into the possession of Henry
Phelps, who sold to Joseph Pope in 1664. His widow, Gertrude, owned it
in 1672. In 1793, Eleazer Pope sold to Nathaniel Ropes, son of Judge
Ropes, of Salem. His heirs sold it back to the Phelpses; and it is now
in the possession of the Rev. Willard Spaulding, of Salem. Originally
given as an ordination present to a minister of the old town, it has,
after the lapse of two hundred and twenty-six years, come round into
the hands of another. The house in which the Popes lived one hundred
and twenty-nine years, and the families that succeeded them for above
half a century more,&#8212;a venerable and picturesque specimen of the
rural architecture, in its best form, of the earliest times,&#8212;has,
within the last ten years, given place to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[i.238]</a></span> new one on the same spot.
In that old house, besides unnumbered and unknown instances of the
same sort, Israel Putnam conducted his courtship; and there, on the
19th of July, 1739, he was married to Hannah, daughter of Joseph Pope.</p>

<p>Contests for what they deemed their rights with the old church and the
border towns and their own town, as in the case just mentioned,
undoubtedly produced a bad effect upon the temper of the people, by
occasional expenses that consumed their substance, and incidents that
sowed the seeds of personal animosities; preparing the way for that
dreadful convulsion which was near at hand. At the very time when the
witchcraft frenzy broke out, they were in the crisis of an
exasperating conflict with Topsfield, occasioned by a wrong done them
by the General Court. This requires to be explained, as it can be, by
a collation of facts of record.</p>

<p>On the 3d of March, 1636, the General Court passed an order that the
bounds of Salem, Ipswich, and Newbury, should extend six miles into
the country. It was afterwards defined to mean that &quot;the six-mile
extent,&quot; as it was called, should be measured from the meeting-houses
of the respective towns. On the 5th of November, 1639, the General
Court passed an order in these words: &quot;Whereas the inhabitants of
Salem have agreed to plant a village near the river that runs to
Ipswich, it is ordered that all the land near their bounds between
Salem and the said river, not belonging to any other town or person by
any former grant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[i.239]</a></span> shall belong to the said village.&quot; On the strength
of this order, the farmers in that part of Salem pushed settlements
out beyond the &quot;six-mile extent,&quot; over the ground thus pledged to
them; cleared off the forests, built houses, brought the land under
culture, erected bridges, made roads, and fulfilled their part of the
contract by preparing to establish their village. Four years after the
General Court had thus pledged to &quot;inhabitants of Salem&quot; the
privileges of a village organization on the lands between &quot;Salem and
the said river,&quot; they authorized some inhabitants of Ipswich, who had
gone there, to establish the village on the territory, independent of
the Salem men. This was an unjustifiable and flagrant violation of the
stipulated agreement on the part of the General Court; because it
appears by their own records, that Salem farmers had promptly
fulfilled the condition on their part by going directly upon the
ground, and getting farms under way there before 1643. This careless
and indefensible procedure by the General Court was the cause of
interminable trouble and strife on the tract between Salem bounds and
the river, introduced the elements of discord, and gave a color of
legal justification to a conflict of authority between Salem and
Ipswich men. It sowed the seeds of animosities which aggravated the
scenes that occurred in Salem Village in 1692. In 1658, the General
Court passed an order creating the town of Topsfield, including the
larger part of these lands within its limits. No heed was paid to the
remonstrances, against these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[i.240]</a></span> proceedings, of the Salem farmers, who
found themselves, without their consent, permanently bereft of the
benefit that had been promised them, cut off from all connection with
the town of Salem, to which they originally belonged, and put in the
outskirts of another town. It was a clear case of wrong, and ought to
have been rectified. But public bodies are more reluctant even than
individuals to acknowledge themselves in fault. The people of Salem
Village joined in earnest protests against the acts of the General
Court. The old town of Salem declared by a public vote, that they had
always regarded the lands in controversy as belonging to the village
which, under the plighted faith of the General Court, their
inhabitants had been forming. But it was all in vain. Neither remedy
nor reparation could be obtained. The struggle against this injustice
lasted until some time after the witchcraft occurrences had
terminated, and was finally brought to a close by an order of the
Court, that the people on the territory might maintain parish
relations with Salem Village or with Topsfield, at their individual
option. Entire satisfaction was never realized until, in 1728, they
were incorporated, in accordance with their petition, into a township,
under the name of Middleton, with parts of Topsfield, Boxford, and
Andover added. During a period of half a century, this grievance
remained unadjusted. The proceedings on the part of the village in its
public action, as shown in the records, were conducted with skill,
ability, and firmness. But the col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[i.241]</a></span>lisions that occurred between
particular parties were violent and bitter. Salem settlers were called
to pay parish and town rates to Topsfield, but refused to do it.
Constables and tax-collectors were defied. Topsfield went so far as to
claim not only unoccupied lands, but lands within fence, with houses
on them, and families within them, and orchards and growing fields
around them, as part of its &quot;commons;&quot; and it disputed the titles
given by Salem. Of course, the question went, in various forms, into
the county courts; but sometimes, there is reason to believe, it came
to a rougher arbitrament, in the depths of the woods, between man and
man.</p>

<p>John Putnam had gone out and settled lands between the &quot;six-mile
extent&quot; of Salem and Ipswich River. Some of his sons had gone with
him. They had two dwelling-houses, cultivated meadows, orchards, &amp;c.
Isaac Burton says, that, one day, when near John Nichols's house, he
heard a tree fall in the woods; and that he went to see who was
chopping there. It seems that Jacob Towne and John How, Topsfield men,
had come in defiance of John Putnam, and cut down a tree before his
face. As they were two to one, Putnam had to swallow the insult; but
he was not the man to let it rest so. He went out shortly after,
accompanied by an adequate force of sons and nephews, and proceeded to
fell the trees. The sound of the axes reached the ears of the
Topsfield men; and Isaac Easty, Sr., John Easty, John Towne, and
Joseph Towne, Jr., undertook to put a stop to the operation. On
reaching the spot, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[i.242]</a></span> warned Putnam against cutting timber. He
replied, &quot;The timber now and here cut down has been felled by me and
my orders;&quot; and he proceeded to say, &quot;I will keep cutting and carrying
away from this land until next March.&quot; They asked him, &quot;What, by
violence?&quot; He answered, &quot;Aye, by violence. You may sue me: you know
where I dwell;&quot; and, turning to his company, he said, &quot;Fall on.&quot; The
Putnams were evidently the stronger party; and the Topsfield men,
counting forces, concluded, in their turn, that discretion, at that
time, was the better part of valor. Such scenes occurred on the
disputed ground for a whole generation. It is not wonderful that all
sorts of animosities were kindled. The fact will be borne in mind,
that Isaac Easty and son, with John Towne and son, constituted the
Topsfield force on this occasion.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted, that these controversies with the surrounding
towns, the mother-church, and the General Court itself, gradually
engendered a very bad state of feeling. The people were deeply
impressed with a conviction that they had been wronged all around and
all the way through. They felt that the whole world was against them;
and when, by a train of mischievous influences, hell itself seemed to
be let loose upon them, it is not strange that they were driven to
distraction.</p>

<p>We come, at last, to that chapter in the history of Salem Village
which will lead us directly to the witchcraft delusion. Its religious
organization was some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[i.243]</a></span>what peculiar; and, although instituted by a
particular arrangement made by the General Court, was, in one or two
features, a complete departure from the ecclesiastical polity
elsewhere rigidly enforced. It was a congregation forbidden, for the
time being, to have a church. It was a society for religious worship,
administered, not by professors of religion or by persons regarded at
all in a religious light, but by householders. The people of the
village liked it, perhaps, all the better for this; and they took hold
of it with a will. Joseph Houlton gave to the parish five and a half
acres of land, in the centre of the village, for the use of the
minister. A parsonage-house was built, &quot;forty-two feet in length,
twenty feet broad, thirteen-feet stud, four chimneys, and no
gable-ends.&quot; It was the custom to have a leanto attached to their
houses, generally on the northern side; and one was finally added to
the parsonage. There was a garden within the enclosure. Joseph
Hutchinson gave an acre out of his broad meadow as a site for the
meeting-house and it was erected; &quot;thirty-four feet in length,
twenty-eight feet broad, and sixteen feet between joints.&quot; Two end
galleries were added, and a &quot;canopy&quot; placed over the pulpit. The
mother-church, having about the same time built a new meeting-house,
voted to give &quot;the farmers their old pulpit and deacons' seats,&quot; which
were brought up and duly installed. In the course of these
proceedings, some slight differences arose among them about matters of
detail, but not more than is usual in such cases. In order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[i.244]</a></span> to
despatch at once all that may be required to be said about the
meeting-houses of the village, it may be allowable here to mention,
that the original building did not survive the century. In 1700,
partly because the growth of the society began to require it, but
mainly, no doubt, to escape from the painful associations which had
become connected with it, a new meeting-house was built on another
site. The old one was dismantled of all its removable parts, and the
site reverted to Joseph Hutchinson. It is supposed that he removed the
frame to the other side of the road, and converted it into a barn; and
that it was used as such until, in the memory of old persons now
living, it mouldered, crumbled into powder-post, and sunk to the
ground. It stood, after being converted into a barn, on the south side
of the road, nearly in front of Joseph Hutchinson's homestead.
Hutchinson's dwelling-house was probably some distance further down in
the field, where the remains of an old cellar are still to be seen.
Nathaniel Ingersoll gave the land for the new meeting-house. The
records contain the vote, that it &quot;shall stand upon Watch-House Hill,
before Deacon Ingersoll's door.&quot; The meeting-houses of the society
have stood there ever since. At that time, it was an elevated spot,
probably covered with the original forest; for the work of clearing,
levelling, and preparing it for occupancy was so considerable as to
require a special provision. The labor and expense of the operation
were put on that portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[i.245]</a></span> congregation brought nearer to the
meeting-house by the change of the site.</p>

<p>In urging their petition to be set off as an independent parish,
distinct from the First Church in Salem, the people of the village
declared, that, if they could not have a ministry established among
them, they would soon &quot;become worse than the heathen around them.&quot;
Little did they foresee the immediate, long-continued, and terrible
effects that were to follow the boon thus prayed for. The
establishment of the ministry among them was not merely an opening of
Pandora's box: it was emptying and shaking it over their heads. It led
them to a condition of bitterness and violence, of confusion and
convulsion, of horror and misery, of cruelty and outrage, worse than
heathen ever experienced or savages inflicted.</p>

<p>James Bayley of Newbury, born Sept. 12, 1650, a graduate of Harvard
College in the class of 1669, was employed to preach at the village.
In October, 1671, he transferred his relations from the church in
Newbury to the First Church in Salem. It seems that several persons of
considerable influence in the village were dissatisfied with the
manner in which he had been brought forward, and became prejudiced
against him. The disaffection was not removed, but suffered to take
deep root in their minds. The parish soon became the scene of one of
those violent and heated dissensions to which religious societies are
sometimes liable. The unhappy strife was aggravated from day to day,
until it spread alienation and acrimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[i.246]</a></span> throughout the village. A
majority of the people were all along in favor of Bayley; but the
minority were implacable. His engagement to preach was renewed from
year to year. At length, the controversy waxed so warm that some
definite action became necessary. On the 10th of March, 1679, both
parties applied to the mother-church for advice. A paper was presented
by his opponents, with sixteen, and another from his friends, with
thirty-nine signers. There was still another, also in his favor,
signed by ten persons living near, but not within the village line.
Although the number of his opponents was so much less than of his
friends, they included persons, such as Nathaniel Putnam and Bray
Wilkins, of large estates and families, and much general influence;
and it is evident that the First Church was not inclined wholly to
disregard them. The record of that church says, &quot;There was much
agitation on both sides, and divers things were spoken of by the
brethren; but the business being long, and many of the brethren gone,
we could not make a church act of advice in the case; therefore it was
left to another time.&quot; At a meeting on the 22d of April, the Salem
Church advised the minority &quot;to submit to the generality for the
present;&quot; but, when a church should be formed there, &quot;then they might
choose him or any other.&quot; This advice does not appear to have
satisfied either party; and the quarrel went on with renewed vehemence
on both sides. At length, it reached such a pitch that it became
necessary to carry it up to the General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[i.247]</a></span> Court. The whole affair was
investigated by that body, and all the papers that had passed in
relation to it were adduced. They are quite voluminous, and on file in
the office of the Secretary of State, in Boston. These interesting and
curious documents illustrate the energy of action of both parties; and
give, it is probable, the best picture anywhere to be found of a
first-rate parish controversy of the olden times.</p>

<p>The General Court came down upon the case with a strong hand. They
decided in favor of Bayley, whom they pronounced &quot;orthodox, and
competently able, and of a blameless and self-denying conversation;&quot;
and they &quot;do order, that Mr. Bayley be continued and settled the
minister of that place, and that he be allowed sixty pounds per annum
for his maintenance, one-third part thereof in money, the other
two-thirds in provisions of all sorts such as a family needs, at equal
prices, and fuel for his family's occasions; this sum to be paid by
the inhabitants of that place.&quot; This was thirteen pounds a year more
than Bayley's friends had ever voted for him. To make the matter sure,
the General Court required the parish to choose three or five men
among themselves to apportion every man's share of the tax to secure
the sixty pounds: and, if any difficulty should occur in getting men
among themselves to perform this duty, they appointed to act, in that
event, Mr. Batter, Captain Jonathan Corwin, and Captain Price, of the
old parish of Salem, to make the rate; and gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[i.248]</a></span> ample power to the
constable of the village or the marshal of the county, to enforce the
collection of it, by distress and attachment, if any should neglect or
refuse to pay the sum assessed upon him. To make it still more certain
that Mr. Bayley should get his money, they ordered &quot;that all the rate
is to be paid in for the use of the ministry unto two persons chosen
by the householders to supply the place of deacons for the time, who
are to reckon with the people, and to deliver the same to the said
minister or to his order.&quot; The arrangement as to the agency of deacons
was &quot;to continue until the Court shall take further order, or that
there be a church of Christ orderly gathered and approved in that
place.&quot; This procedure of the Court was a pretty high-handed stretch
of power even for those days; and giving the appointment of officers,
with the title and character of deacons to mere householders, and
where there was no church or organized body of professed believers,
was in absolute conflict with the whole tenor and spirit of the
ecclesiastical system then in force and rigidly maintained elsewhere
throughout the colony. The Court seems itself to have been alarmed at
the extent to which it had gone in forcing Mr. Bayley upon the people
of Salem Village, and fell back, in conclusion, upon the following
proviso: &quot;This order shall continue for one year only from the last of
September last past.&quot; The date of the order was the 15th of October,
1679. It had less than a year to run. In fact, the order, after all,
before it comes to the end, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[i.249]</a></span> diluted into a mere recommendation of
Mr. Bayley. &quot;In the mean while, all parties,&quot; it is hoped, will
&quot;endeavor an agreement in him or some other meet person for a minister
among them;&quot; but the General Court takes care to wind up by demanding
&quot;five pounds for hearing the case, the whole number of villagers
equally to bear their proportion thereof.&quot;</p>

<p>While the power thus incautiously conceded to householders was duly
noted, the apparently formidable action of the Court did not in the
least alarm the opposition, or in the slightest degree abate their
zeal. The householders continued, as before, to manage all affairs
relating to the ministry in general meetings of the inhabitants. They
proceeded at once to elect their two deacons. &quot;Corporal Nathaniel
Ingersoll&quot; was one of them; and he continued to hold the office, in
parish and in church, for forty years.</p>

<p>As no attention was paid to the order of the General Court, so far as
it attempted to fasten Mr. Bayley upon the parish; as the church in
Salem would not take the responsibility of recommending his ordination
in the face of such an opposition; and as it was out of the question
to think of reconciling or reducing it, Mr. Bayley concluded to retire
from the conflict and quit the field; and his ministry in the village
came to an end. As evidence that the heat of this protracted
controversy had not consumed all just and considerate sentiments in
the minds of the people, I present the substance of a deed found in
the Essex Registry. It will be noticed, that the most conspicu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[i.250]</a></span>ous of
Mr. Bayley's opponents, Nathaniel Putnam, is one of the parties to the
instrument.</p>

<p>&quot;Thomas Putnam, Sr., Nathaniel Putnam, Sr., Thomas Fuller, Sr., John
Putnam, Sr., and Joseph Hutchinson, Sr. Deed of gift to Mr. James
Bayley. Whereas, Mr. James Bayley, minister of the gospel, now
resident of Salem Village, hath been in the exercise of his gifts by
preaching amongst us several years, having had a call thereunto by the
inhabitants of the place; and at the said Mr. Bayley's first coming
amongst us, we above-named put the said Bayley in possession of a
suitable accommodation of land and meadow, for his more comfortable
subsistence amongst us. But the providence of God having so ordered
it, that the said Mr. Bayley doth not continue amongst us in the work
of the ministry, yet, considering the premises, and as a testimony of
our good affection to the said Mr. Bayley, and as full satisfaction of
all demands of us or any of us, of land relating to the premises, do
by these presents fully grant, &amp;c., to said Bayley&quot; twenty-eight acres
of upland, and thirteen acres of meadow in all. The several lots are
described in the deed, and constitute a very valuable property. The
instrument bears date May 6, 1680. Mr. Bayley's residence is indicated
on the <a href="#map">map</a>. The land on which it stood belonged to the part
contributed by Nathaniel Putnam, with some acres in front of it
contributed by Joseph Hutchinson. He continued to own and occasionally
occupy his property in the village for some years after the witchcraft
trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[i.251]</a></span>actions. He left the ministry, and prepared himself for the
profession of medicine, which he practised in Roxbury. He died on the
17th of January, 1707.</p>

<p>It is not very easy to ascertain from the parish records, or from the
mass of papers in the State-house files, the precise grounds of the
obstinate controversy in reference to him. It is evident that it began
in consequence of some alleged irregularity in the proceedings that
led to his first engagement to preach at the village. There are
intimations, that, in the tone and style of his preaching, he did not
quite come up to the mark required by some. The objection does not
seem to have been against his talents or learning, but, rather, that
he did not take hold with sufficient vehemence, or handle with
sufficient zeal and warmth, points then engrossing attention. One or
two expressions in the papers which proceeded from his opponents seem
to hint that he had not the degree of strictness or severity in his
aspect or ways thought necessary in a minister. Papers in the files of
the County Court bring to light, perhaps, precisely the shape in which
the charges against him had currency. On the 4th of April, 1679,
complaint was made by Thomas and John Putnam, Srs., Daniel Andrew, and
Nathaniel Ingersoll, against Henry Kenny &quot;for slandering our minister,
Mr. Bayley, by reporting that he doth not perform family duties in his
family.&quot; This was an expression then in use for &quot;family prayers.&quot; One
young woman testified as follows: &quot;Being at Mr. Bayley's house three
weeks together, I never heard Mr. Bayley read a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[i.252]</a></span> chapter, nor expound
on any part of the Scripture, which was a great grief to me.&quot; On the
other hand, three men and one woman depose thus: &quot;Having, for a year,
some more, some less, since Mr. Bayley's coming to Salem Farms, lived
at his house, we testify to our knowledge, that he hath continually
performed family duties, morning and evening, unless sickness or some
other unavoidable providence hath prevented.&quot; Two of the above
witnesses depose more specifically as follows: &quot;We testify,&#8212;one of us
being a boarder at Mr. Bayley's house, at times, for two or three
years, and the other having lived there about a year and a
quarter,&#8212;that Mr. Bayley did not only constantly perform family
prayers twice a day, except some unusual providence at any time
prevented, but also did sometimes read the Scriptures and other
profitable books, and also repeat his own sermons in his family that
he preached upon the Lord's Days; always endeavoring to keep good
order in his family, carrying himself exemplarily therein.&quot; The
evidence against Bayley was afterwards found to be unworthy of credit,
and was wholly overborne at the time by unimpeachable testimony in his
favor. The conclusion seems to be safe, from all the papers and
proceedings, that Mr. Bayley was, as the General Court had pronounced
him, &quot;of a blameless conversation.&quot; A letter from him to his people,
relating to the disaffection of some, and expressing a willingness to
relinquish his position, if the interests of the society would thereby
be promoted, is among the papers. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[i.253]</a></span> is creditable to his
understanding, temper, and character.</p>

<p>The opposition to Mr. Bayley laid the train for all the disastrous and
terrible scenes that followed. His wife was Mary Carr, of Salisbury.
Her family, besides land in that town, owned the large island in the
Merrimack, just above Newburyport, called still by their name, and
occupied by their descendants to this day. Mrs. Bayley brought with
her to the village a younger sister, Ann, who, when scarcely sixteen
years of age,&#8212;on the 25th of November, 1678,&#8212;married Sergeant Thomas
Putnam. The Carrs were evidently well-educated young women; and there
is every indication that Ann was possessed of qualities which gave her
much influence in private circles. Her husband was the eldest son of
the richest man in the village, had the most powerful and extensive
connections, was a member of the company of troopers, had been in the
Narragansett fight, and, as his records show, was a well-educated
person. Marriage with him brought his wife into the centre of the
great Putnam family; and, her sister Bayley being the wife of the
minister, a powerful combination was secured to his support. The
opposition so obstinately made to his settlement, appearing to his
friends, as it does to us, so unreasonable, if not perverse,
engendered a very bitter resentment, which spread from house to house.
Every thing served to aggravate it. The disregard, by the opposition,
of the advice of the old church to agree to his ordination, and of the
strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[i.254]</a></span> endorsement of him by the General Court; and the failure of
either of those bodies to take the responsibility of proceeding to his
ordination,&#8212;made the dissatisfaction and disappointment of his
friends intense. His connection by marriage with such a wide-spread
influence, and the harmony and happiness of social life, made his
settlement so very desirable that his friends could not account for
the resistance made to it. His amiable character, which had been shown
to be proof against slander; and his domestic bereavements in the loss
of his wife and three children,&#8212;made him dear to his friends. More
than three to one earnestly, persistently, from year to year, begged
that he might be ordained; but what was regarded as an unworthy
faction was permitted to succeed in preventing it. All these things
sunk deep into the heart of the wife of Sergeant Thomas Putnam. She
was a woman of an excitable temperament, and, by her talents, zeal,
and personal qualities, wrought all within her influence into the
highest state of exasperation. This must be borne in mind when we
reach the details of our story. It is the key to all that followed.</p>

<p>The friends of Bayley, while they yielded to his determination to
withdraw from his disagreeable position, never relinquished the hope
to get him back, but renewed a struggle to that end, whenever a
vacancy occurred in the village ministry. With that object in view,
they were unwise and unjust enough to cherish aversion to every one
who succeeded him, and thus kept alive the fatal elements of division.
But it is due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[i.255]</a></span> him to say, that he does not appear to have been at
all responsible for the course of his friends. Although retaining his
property in the village, and often residing there, there is no
indication that he had a hand in subsequent proceedings, or was in the
slightest degree connected with the troubles that afterwards arose.
Arts were used to inveigle him into the witchcraft prosecutions: his
resentments, if he had any, were invoked; but in vain. He resisted
attempts, which were made with more effect upon one of his successors,
to rouse his passions against parties accused. He kept himself free
from the whole affair. His name nowhere appears as complainant,
witness, or actor in any shape. He was, so far as the evidence goes, a
peaceable, prudent, kind, and good man; and if the people of Salem
Village had been wise enough, or been permitted, to settle him, the
world might never have known that such a place existed.</p>

<p>George Burroughs, in November, 1680, was engaged to preach at Salem
Village. He is supposed to have been born in Scituate; but his origin
is as uncertain as his history was sad, and his end tragical. He was a
graduate of Harvard College in the class of 1670. What little is known
of him shows that he was a man of ability and integrity. Papers on
file in the State House prove, that, in the district of Maine, where
he lived and preached before and after his settlement at the village,
he was regarded with confidence by his neighbors, and looked up to as
a friend and counsellor. Certain incidents are related, which prove
that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[i.256]</a></span> self-denying, generous, and public-spirited, laboring in
humility and with zeal in the midst of great privations, sharing the
exposures of his people to Indian violence, and experiencing all the
sufferings of an unprotected outpost. In 1676, while preaching at
Casco,&#8212;now Portland,&#8212;the entire settlement was broken up by an
Indian assault. Thirty-two of the inhabitants were killed or carried
into captivity. Mr. Burroughs escaped to an island in the bay, from
which he was rescued by timely aid from the mainland. He wrote an
account of the catastrophe, communicated by Brian Pendleton to the
Governor and Council at Boston. In 1683 he was again at Casco; and,
again driven off by the Indians in 1690, transferred his labors to
Wells. A grant of one hundred and fifty acres of land was made to him,
included in the site of the present city of Portland. As population
began to thicken near the spot, the town applied to him to relinquish
a part of it, other lands to be given him in exchange. In their
account of the transaction, they state, that, in answer to their
application, Mr. Burroughs said they were welcome to it; that he
freely gave it back, &quot;not desiring any land anywhere else, nor any
thing else in consideration thereof.&quot;</p>

<p>In a vote passed at a meeting of Salem Village parish, Feb. 10, 1681,
it was agreed that Mr. Burroughs should receive &#163;93. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per
annum for three years, and &#163;60 per annum afterwards. I suppose that he
had no money or property of any kind. The parsonage was out of repair;
and the larger sum for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[i.257]</a></span> three years, amounting to &#163;100, in
three instalments, was to be given him as an outfit in housekeeping.
Immediately upon coming to the village to reside, he encountered the
hostility of those persons who, as the special friends of Mr. Bayley,
allowed their prejudices to be concentrated upon his innocent
successor. The unhappy animosities arising from this source entirely
demoralized the Society, and, besides making it otherwise very
uncomfortable to a minister, led to a neglect and derangement of all
financial affairs. In September, 1681, Mr. Burroughs's wife died, and
he had to run in debt for her funeral expenses. Rates were not
collected, and his salary was in arrears. In making the contract with
the parish, he had taken care to add, at the end of the articles,
these words, &quot;All is to be understood so long as I have gospel
encouragement.&quot; It is not improbable that there was a lack of sympathy
between him and the ministers in this part of the country. He
concluded that no benefit would accrue from calling a council to put
things into order; and, as he was in despair of remedying the evils
that had become fastened upon the village, he concluded to give up the
idea of getting a settlement of his accounts, abandoned his claims
altogether, and removed from the village.</p>

<p>At the April term of Court in Ipswich, 1683, a committee of the parish
petitioned for relief, stating that Mr. Burroughs had left them, and
that they had been without services in their meeting-house for four
sabbaths. They pray the Court, that &quot;they be pleased to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[i.258]</a></span> write to Mr.
Burroughs, requiring him to attend an orderly hearing and clearing up
the case,&quot; and &quot;to come to account&quot; with them. The Court accordingly
directed a meeting of the inhabitants to be held, and wrote to Mr.
Burroughs to attend it. When the day came, the Court sent a letter to
be read at the meeting, directing the parties to &quot;reckon,&quot; and settle
their accounts. What transpired at this curious meeting is best given
by presenting the documents on file in a case that went into Court.
They show the proceedings that interrupted the &quot;reckoning&quot; at the
meeting in a most extraordinary manner:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">County Court</span>, June, 1683.&#8212;Lieutenant John Putnam
<i>versus</i> Mr. George Burroughs. Action of debt for two
gallons of Canary wine, and cloth, &amp;c., bought of Mr. Gedney
on John Putnam's account, for the funeral of Mrs.
Burroughs.]</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&quot;<i>Deposition</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;We, whose names are underwritten, testify and say, that at
a public meeting of the people of Salem Farms, April 24,
1683, we heard a letter read, which letter was sent from the
Court. After the said letter was read, Mr. Burroughs came
in. After the said Burroughs had been a while in, he asked
'whether they took up with the advice of the Court, given in
the letter, or whether they rejected it.' The moderator made
answer, 'Yes, we take up with it;' and not a man
contradicted it to any of our hearing. After this was
passed, was a discourse of settling accounts between the
said Burroughs and the inhabitants, and issuing things in
peace, and parting in love, as they came together in love.
Further, we say that the second, third, and fourth days of
the following week were agreed upon by Mr. Burroughs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[i.259]</a></span>
the people to be the days for every man to come in and to
reckon with the said Burroughs; and so they adjourned the
meeting to the last of the aforesaid three days, in the
afternoon, then to make up the whole account in public.</p>

<p>&quot;We further testify and say, that, May the second, 1683, Mr.
Burroughs and the inhabitants met at the meeting-house to
make up accounts in public, according to their agreement the
meeting before; and, just as the said Burroughs began to
give in his accounts, the marshal came in, and, after a
while, went up to John Putnam, Sr., and whispered to him,
and said Putnam said to him, 'You know what you have to do:
do your office.' Then the marshal came to Mr. Burroughs, and
said, 'Sir, I have a writing to read to you.' Then he read
the attachment, and demanded goods. Mr. Burroughs answered,
'that he had no goods to show, and that he was now reckoning
with the inhabitants, for we know not yet who is in debt,
but there was his body.' As we were ready to go out of the
meeting-house, Mr. Burroughs said, 'Well, what will you do
with me?' Then the marshal went to John Putnam, Sr., and
said to him, 'What shall I do?' The said Putnam replied,
'You know your business.' And then the said Putnam went to
his brother, Thomas Putnam, and pulled him by the coat; and
they went out of the house together, and presently came in
again. Then said John Putnam, 'Marshal, take your prisoner,
and have him up to the ordinary,&#8212;that is a public
house,&#8212;and secure him till the morning.'</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;To the first of these, I, John Putnam, Jr., testify, being
at the meeting.&quot;</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[i.260]</a></span></p>

<p>The above document illustrates the general position of the Putnam
family through all the troubles of the Salem Village parish. Thomas
and John were the heads of two of its branches, and participated in
the proceedings against Burroughs. Nathaniel generally was on the
other side in the course of the various controversies which finally
culminated in the witchcraft delusion. His son, John Putnam, Jr., on
this occasion, was a witness friendly to Mr. Burroughs. Nathaniel
Ingersoll does not appear to have been a partisan on either side. His
sympathies, generally, were with the friends of Bayley; but, on this
occasion, his sense of justice led him to take the lead in behalf of
Burroughs. Other depositions are as follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;<span class="smcap">The Testimony of Thomas Haynes</span>, aged thirty-two
years or thereabouts.&#8212;Testifieth and saith, that, at a
meeting of the inhabitants of Salem Farms, May the second,
1683, after the marshal had read John Putnam's attachment to
Mr. Burroughs, then Mr. Burroughs asked Putnam 'what money
it was he attached him for.' John Putnam answered, 'For five
pounds and odd money at Shippen's at Boston, and for
thirteen shillings at his father Gedney's, and for
twenty-four shillings at Mrs. Darby's;' that then Nathaniel
Ingersoll stood up, and said, 'Lieutenant, I wonder that you
attach Mr. Burroughs for the money at Darby's and your
father Gedney's, when, to my knowledge, you and Mr.
Burroughs have reckoned and balanced accounts two or three
times since, as you say, it was due, and you never made any
mention of it when you reckoned with Mr. Burroughs.' John
Putnam answered, 'It is true, and I own it.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[i.261]</a></span> Samuel Sibley,
aged twenty-four years or thereabouts, testifieth to all
above written.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">The Testimony of Nathaniel Ingersoll</span>, <i>aged,
&amp;c.</i>&#8212;Testifieth, that I heard Mr. Burroughs ask Lieutenant
John Putnam to give him a bill to Mr. Shippen. The said
Putnam asked the said Burroughs how much he would take up at
Mr. Shippen's. Mr. Burroughs said it might be five pounds;
but, after the said Burroughs had considered a little, he
said to the said Putnam, 'It may be it might come to more:'
therefore he would have him give him a bill to the value of
five or six pounds,&#8212;when Putnam answered, it was all one to
him. Then the said Putnam went and writ it, and read it to
Mr. Burroughs, and said to him that it should go for part of
the &#163;33. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for which he had given a bill to him in
behalf of the inhabitants. I, Hannah Ingersoll, aged
forty-six years or thereabouts, testify the same.&quot;</p></div>

<p>It seems by the foregoing, that Mr. Burroughs had presented a bill, of
the amount just mentioned, to John Putnam, who, as chairman of the
committee the preceding year, represented the inhabitants; and it was
deliberately and formally agreed, that the sum borrowed of Putnam by
Burroughs should &quot;go for part of it.&quot; The records of the parish show,
that, on the 24th of May,&#8212;three weeks after this meeting &quot;for
reckoning,&quot;&#8212;a vote was passed to raise, by a rate, &quot;fifteen pounds
for Mr. Burroughs for the last quarter of a year he preached with us.&quot;
At a meeting in December of the same year, a rate was ordered, to pay
the debts of the parish, amounting to &#163;52. 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> On the 22d of
the ensuing February, the parish voted to raise &quot;fifteen pounds for
Mr. Burroughs.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[i.262]</a></span> The record of a meeting in April, 1684, contains an
order, left on the book, with Mr. Burroughs's proper signature,
authorizing Lieutenant Thomas Putnam to receive of the committee &quot;what
is due to me from the inhabitants of Salem Farms.&quot; Thus it is evident,
that, at the very day when the ruthless proceedings above described
took place, a considerable balance was due to Mr. Burroughs, after all
claims from all quarters had been &quot;reckoned.&quot; The return of the
marshal, made to the Court, was as follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;I have attached the body of George Burroughs he tendered to
me,&#8212;for he said he had no pay,&#8212;and taken bonds to the
value of fourteen pounds money, and read this to him.</p>

<p>Per me,</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Henry Skerry</span>, <i>Marshal</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The bond is as follows. I give the names of the signers. The persons
who interposed to rescue a persecuted man from unjust imprisonment
deserve to be held in honored remembrance.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;We whose names are underwritten do bind ourselves jointly
and severally to Henry Skerry, Marshal of Salem, our heirs,
executors, and administrators, in the sum of fourteen pounds
money, that George Burroughs shall appear at the next court
at Salem, to answer to Lieutenant John Putnam, according to
the summons of this attachment, and to abide the order of
the court therein, and not to depart without license; as
witness our hands this 2d of May, 1683.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[i.263]</a></span></p>

<p>The case was withdrawn, and Burroughs was glad to get away. He
preferred the Indians at Casco Bay to the people here. When we
consider, that a committee of the parish petitioned the Court to have
such a meeting of the inhabitants; that it was held, by an order of
Court, in compliance with said petition; that Burroughs came back to
the village to attend it; that the meeting agreed, in answer to an
inquiry from him to that effect, to conform to the order of the Court
in making it the occasion of a full and final &quot;reckoning&quot; between
them; that they spent two days and a half in bringing in and sifting
all claims on either side; and that, when, at the time agreed
upon,&#8212;the afternoon of the third day,&#8212;the whole body of the
inhabitants had come together to ratify and give effect to the
&quot;reckoning,&quot; the marshal came in with a writ, and, evidently in
violation of his feelings, was forced by John Putnam to arrest
Burroughs, thereby breaking up the proceedings asked for by the parish
and ordered by the Court, for a debt which he did not owe,&#8212;it must be
allowed, that it was one of the most audacious and abominable outrages
ever committed.</p>

<p>The scene presented in these documents is perhaps as vivid, and brings
the actual life before us as strikingly, as any thing that has come
down to us from that day. We can see, as though we were looking in at
the door, the spectacle presented in the old meeting-house: the
farmers gathered from their remote and widely scattered plantations,
some possibly coming in travelling family-vehicles,&#8212;although it is
quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[i.264]</a></span> uncertain whether there were any at that time among the
farmers; some in companies on farm-carts; many on foot; but the
greater number on horseback, in their picturesque costume of homespun
or moose-skin, with cowl-shaped hoods, or hats with a brim, narrow in
front, but broad and slouching behind, hanging over the shoulders.
Every man was belted and sworded. They did not wear weapons merely for
show. There was half a score of men in that assembly who were in the
Narragansett fight; and some bore on their persons scars from that
bloody scene of desperate heroism. Every man, it is probable, had come
to the meeting with his firelock on his shoulder, to defend himself
and companions against Indians lurking in the thick woods through
which they had to pass. Their countenances bespoke the passions to
which they had been wrought up by their fierce parish
quarrels,&#8212;rugged, severe, and earnest. We can see the grim bearing of
the cavalry lieutenant, John Putnam, and of his elder brother and
predecessor in commission. Marshal Skerry, with his badges of office,
is reluctant to execute its functions upon a persecuted and penniless
minister; but, in accordance with the stern demands of the inexorable
prosecutors, is faithful still to his painful duty. The minister is
the central object in the picture,&#8212;a small, dark-complexioned man,
the amazed but calm and patient victim of an animosity in which he had
no part, and for which he was in no wise responsible. The unresisting
dignity of his bearing is quite observable. &quot;We are now reckoning; we
know not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[i.265]</a></span> yet who is in debt. I have no pay; but here is my body.&quot;
Perhaps, in that unconspicuous frame, and through that humble garb,
the sinewy nerves and muscles of steel, the compact and concentrated
forces, that were the marvel of his times, and finally cost him his
life, were apparent in his movements and attitudes. It may be, that
the sufferings and exposures of his previous life had left upon his
swarthy features a stamp of care and melancholy, foreshadowing the
greater wrongs and trials in store for him. But the chief figure in
the group is the just man who rose and rebuked the harsh and
reprehensible procedure of the powerful landholder, neighbor and
friend though he was. The manner in which the arbitrary trooper bowed
to the rebuke, if it does not mitigate our resentment of his conduct,
illustrates the extraordinary influence of Nathaniel Ingersoll's
character, and demonstrates the deference in which all men held him.</p>

<p>There are in this affair other points worthy of notice, as showing the
effects of their bitter feuds in rendering them insensible to every
appeal of charity or humanity. Their minds had become so soured, and
their sense of what was right so impaired, that they neglected and
refused to fulfil their most ordinary obligations to each other, and
to themselves as a society. Rates were not collected, and contracts
were not complied with. The minister and his family were left without
the necessaries of life. They were compelled to borrow even their
clothing, articles of which constituted a part of the debt for which
he was arrested in such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[i.266]</a></span> public and unfeeling manner. A young woman
testifies that she lived with Mr. Burroughs about two years, and says:
&quot;My mistress did tell me that she had some serge of John Putnam's
wife, to make Mary a coat; and also some fustian of his wife, to make
my mistress a pair of sleeves.&quot; The principal items in the account
were for articles required at the death of his wife, by the usages of
that day on funeral occasions. Surely it was an outrage upon human
nature to spring a suit at law and have a writ served on him, and take
him as a prisoner, on such an occasion, under such circumstances, on
an alleged debt incurred by such a bereavement, when poverty and
necessity had left him no alternative. The whole procedure receives
the stamp, not only of cruelty, but of infamy, from the fact, which
Nathaniel Ingersoll compelled Putnam to acknowledge before the whole
congregation, that the account had been settled and the debt paid long
before.</p>

<p>John Putnam, although a hard and stern man, had many traits of dignity
and respectability in his character. That he could have done this
thing, in this way, proves the extent to which prejudice and passion
may carry one, particularly where party spirit consumes individual
reason and conscience. At this point it is well to consider a piece of
testimony brought against Burroughs nine years afterwards. There was
no propriety or sense in giving it when it was adduced. It was, in
truth, an outrage to have introduced such testimony in a case where
Burroughs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[i.267]</a></span> was on trial for witchcraft; and it was allowed, only to
prejudice and mislead the minds of a jury and of the public. But it is
proper to be taken into view, in forming a just estimate, with an
impartial aim, of his general character. The document is found in a
promiscuous bundle of witchcraft papers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;<span class="smcap">The Deposition of John Putnam and Rebecca his
Wife.</span>&#8212;Testifieth and saith, that, in the year 1680,
Mr. Burroughs lived in our house nine months. There being a
great difference betwixt said Burroughs and his wife, the
difference was so great that they did desire us, the
deponents, to come into their room to hear their difference.
The controversy that was betwixt them was, that the
aforesaid Burroughs did require his wife to give him a
written covenant, under her hand and seal, that she would
never reveal his secrets. Our answer was, that they had once
made a covenant we did conceive did bind each other to keep
their lawful secrets. And further saith, that, all the time
that said Burroughs did live at our house, he was a very
harsh and sharp man to his wife; notwithstanding, to our
observation, she was a very good and dutiful wife to him.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The first observation that occurs in examining this piece of testimony
is, that the answer made by Putnam and his wife was excellent, and,
like every thing from him, shows that he was a man of strong common
sense, and had a forcible and effectual way of expressing himself. The
next thing to be considered is, that Mr. Burroughs probably
discovered, soon after coming to the village, into what a hornets'
nest he had got,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[i.268]</a></span>&#8212;every one tattling about and backbiting each other.
His innocent and unsuspicious wife may have indulged a little in what
is considered the amiable proclivity of her sex, and have let fall, in
tea-table talk, what cavillers and mischief-makers were on hand to
take up; and he may have found it both necessary and difficult to
teach her caution and reserve. He saw, more perhaps than she did, the
danger of getting involved in the personal acrimonies with which the
whole community was poisoned. Her unguarded carelessness might get
herself and him into trouble, and vitally impair their happiness and
his usefulness. The only other point to be remarked upon is the
general charge against Mr. Burroughs's temper and disposition. It may
be that he became so disgusted with the state of things as to have
shown some acerbity in his manners, but such a supposition is not in
harmony with what little is known of him from other sources; and John
Putnam's conduct at the meeting described proves that his mind was
fully perverted, and bereft as it were of all moral rectitude of
judgment, in reference to Mr. Burroughs. We must part with Mr.
Burroughs for the present. We shall meet him again, where the powers
of malignity will be more shamelessly let loose upon him, and prevail
to his destruction.</p>

<p>He was succeeded in the ministry at Salem Village by a character of a
totally different class. Deodat Lawson is first heard of in this
country, according to Mr. Savage, at Martha's Vineyard in 1671. He
took the freeman's oath at Boston in 1680, and continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[i.269]</a></span> to have his
residence there. It was not until after much negotiation and
considerable importunity, that he was prevailed upon to enter into an
engagement to preach at the Village. He began his ministry early in
1684, as appears by the parish record of a meeting Feb. 22, 1684:
&quot;Voted that Joseph Herrick, Jonathan Putnam, and Goodman Cloyse are
desired to take care for to get a boat for the removing of Mr.
Lawson's goods.&quot; Votes, about this time, were passed to repair the
parsonage, and the fences around the ministry land; thus putting
things in readiness to receive him. It does not appear that he became
particularly entangled in the conflicts which had so long disturbed
the Village, although, while the mother-church signified its readiness
to approve of his ordination, and some movement was made in the
Village to that end, it was found impossible to bring the hostile
parties sufficiently into co-operation to allow of any thing being
definitely accomplished. Fortunately for Mr. Lawson, the spirit of
strife found other objects upon which to expend its energies for the
time being. Some persons brought forward complaints, that the records
of the parish had not been correctly kept (this was before Sergeant
Thomas Putnam had been charged with that trust); that votes which had
passed in &quot;Mr. Bayley's days&quot; and in &quot;Mr. Burroughs's days&quot; had not
been truly recorded, or recorded at all; and that what had never been
passed had been entered as votes. A great agitation arose on this
subject, and many meetings were held. Some demanded that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[i.270]</a></span> spurious
votes should be expunged; others, that the omitted votes should be
inserted. Then there was an excited disputation about the ministry
lands, and the validity or sufficiency of their title to them. Joseph
Houlton had given them; but he had nothing to do with raising the
question, and did all he could to suppress it. Some person had
discovered that William Haynes, to whom Houlton had succeeded by the
right of his wife, had omitted to get his deed of purchase recorded,
and the original could not be found. Disputes also arose about the use
of the grounds around the meeting-house. These, added to the conflicts
with the &quot;Topsfield men,&quot; and matters not fully adjusted with the town
of Salem, created and kept up a violent fermentation, in which all
were miscellaneously involved. In the midst of this confusion, the
matter of ordaining Mr. Lawson was put into the warrant for a meeting
to be held on the 10th of December, 1686. But it was found impossible
to recall the people from their divisions, and no favorable action
could be had.</p>

<p>At length, all attempts to settle their difficulties among themselves
were abandoned; and they called for help from outside. At a legally
warned meeting on the 17th of January, 1687, the inhabitants made
choice of &quot;Captain John Putnam&quot; (he had been promoted in the military
line since the affair in the meeting-house with Mr. Burroughs),
&quot;Lieutenant Jonathan Walcot, Ensign Thomas Flint, and Corporal Joseph
Herrick, for to transact with Joseph Hutchinson, Job Swinnerton,
Joseph Porter, and Daniel An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[i.271]</a></span>drew about their grievances relating to
the public affairs of this place; and, if they cannot agree among
themselves, that then they shall refer their differences to the
Honored Major Gedney and John Hathorne, Esqs., and to the reverend
elders of the Salem Church, for a full determination of those
differences.&quot; Of course, it was impossible to settle the matter among
themselves, and the referees were called in. William Brown, Jr., Esq.,
was added to them. They were all of the old town, and men of the
highest consideration. Their judgment in the case is a well-drawn and
interesting document, and shows the view which near neighbors took of
the distractions in the village. The following passage will exhibit
the purport and spirit of it:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;<i>Loving Brethren, Friends and Neighbors</i>,&#8212;Upon serious
consideration of, and mature deliberation upon, what hath
been offered to us about your calling and transacting in
order to the settling and ordaining the Rev. Mr. Deodat
Lawson, and the grievances offered by some to obstruct and
impede that proceeding, our sense of the matter is
this,&#8212;first, that the affair of calling and transacting in
order to the settling and ordaining the Reverend Mr. Lawson
hath not been so inoffensively managed as might have
been,&#8212;at least, not in all the parts and passages of it;
second, that the grievances offered by some amongst you are
not in themselves of sufficient weight to obstruct so great
a work, and that they have not been improved so peaceably
and orderly as Christian prudence and self-denial doth
direct; third, to our grief, we observe such uncharitable
expressions and uncomely reflections tossed to and fro as
look like the effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[i.272]</a></span> of settled prejudice and resolved
animosity, though we are much rather willing to account them
the product of weakness than wilfulness: however, we must
needs say, that, come whence they will, they have a tendency
to make such a gap as we fear, if not timely prevented, will
let out peace and order, and let in confusion and every evil
work.&quot;</p></div>

<p>They then proceed to give some good advice to &quot;prevent contention and
trouble for the future, that it may not devour for ever, and that, if
the Lord please, you may be happier henceforth than to make one
another miserable; and not make your place uncomfortable to your
present, and undesirable to any other, minister, and the ministry
itself in a great measure unprofitable: and that you may not bring
impositions on yourselves by convincing all about you that you cannot,
or will not, use your liberty as becomes the gospel.&quot; Their advice is,
&quot;that you desist, at present, from urging the ordination of the Rev.
Mr. Lawson, till your spirits are better quieted and composed.&quot; They
give some judicious suggestions about various matters that had been
the occasion of difficulty among them, especially to help them get
their records put into good shape, and kept so for the future; and
wind up in the following excellent, and in some of the clauses rather
emphatic and pithy, expressions:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Finally, we think peace cheap, if it may be procured by
complying with the aforementioned particulars, which are
few, fair, and easy; and that they will hardly pass for
lovers of peace, truth, ministry, and order, in the day of
the Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[i.273]</a></span> that shall so lean to their own understanding and
will that they shall refuse such easy methods for the
obtaining of them. And, if peace and agreement amongst you
be once comfortably obtained, we advise you with all
convenient speed to go on with your intended ordination; and
so we shall follow our advice with our prayers. But, if our
advice be rejected, we wish you better, and hearts to follow
it; and only add, if you will unreasonably trouble
yourselves, we pray you not any further to trouble us. We
leave all to the blessing of God, the wonderful Counsellor,
and your own serious consideration: praying you to read and
consider the whole, and then act as God shall direct you.
Farewell.&quot;</p>

<p>[Salem, Feb. 14, 1687. Signed by the five referees,&#8212;John
Higginson and Nicholas Noyes (the elders of the old church),
and the three gentlemen before named.]</p></div>

<p>At a meeting of the inhabitants of the Village on the 18th of
February, it was voted that &quot;we do accept of and embrace the advice of
the honored and reverend gentlemen of Salem, sent to us under their
hands, and order that it shall be entered on our book of records.&quot; But
they took care further to vote, that they accepted it &quot;in general, and
not in parts.&quot; In accordance with the advice of the referees, they
brought up, considered anew, and put to question, every entry in their
past records about the genuineness and validity of which any division
of opinion existed. Some entries that had been complained of and given
offence as incorrect were voted out, and others were confirmed by
being adopted on a new vote. A new book of records was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[i.274]</a></span> prepared, to
conform to these decisions, which, having been submitted for
examination to leading persons, appointed for the purpose at a legal
meeting representing both parties, and approved by them, was adopted
and sanctioned at a subsequent meeting also called for the purpose.</p>

<p>In accordance with the same advice &quot;that the old book of records be
kept in being,&quot; it was ordered by the meeting to leave the votes that
had, by the foregoing proceedings, been rendered null and void, to
&quot;lie in the old book of records as they are.&quot; From the new book of
records we learn that &quot;some votes are left out that passed in Mr.
Bayley's days, and some that passed in Mr. Burroughs's days,&quot;
particularly all the votes but one that passed at a meeting held on
the fifth day of June, 1683, the very time that Mr. Burroughs was
under bonds in the action of debt brought by John Putnam. The new
record specifies some few, but not all, of the votes that were
rescinded because it was adjudged that they had not rightfully passed,
or been correctly stated. Unfortunately, the old book, after all, has
not been &quot;kept in being;&quot; and much that would have exhibited more
fully and clearly the unhappy early history of the parish is for ever
lost. If the records that have been suffered to remain present the
picture I have endeavored faithfully to draw, how much darker might
have been its shades had we been permitted to behold what the parties
concerned concurred in thinking too bad to be left to view!</p>

<p>The attempt to expunge records is always indefensi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[i.275]</a></span>ble, besides being
in itself irrational and absurd. It may cover up the details of wrong
and folly; but it leaves an unlimited range to the most unfriendly
conjecture. We are compelled to imagine what we ought to be allowed to
know; and, in many particulars, our fancies may be worse than the
facts. But later times, and public bodies of greater pretensions than
&quot;the inhabitants of Salem Village,&quot; have attempted, and succeeded in
perpetrating, this outrage upon history. In trying to conceal their
errors, men have sometimes destroyed the means of their vindication.
This may be the case with the story that is to be told of &quot;Salem
Witchcraft.&quot; It has been the case in reference to wider fields of
history. The Parliamentary journals and other public records of the
period of the Commonwealth and the Protectorate were suppressed by the
infatuated stupidity of the Government of the Restoration. They
foolishly imagined that they were hiding the shame, while they were
obscuring the glory, of their country. Every Englishman, every
intelligent man, now knows, that, during that very period, all that
has made England great was done. The seeds of her naval and maritime
prosperity were planted: and she was pushed at once by wise measures
of policy, internal and external; by legislation developing her
resources and invigorating the power of her people; by a decisive and
comprehensive diplomacy that commanded the respect of foreign courts,
and secured to her a controlling influence upon the traffic of the
world; by developments of her military genius under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[i.276]</a></span> the greatest of
all the great generals of modern times; and by naval achievements that
snatched into her hands the balancing trident of the seas,&#8212;to the
place she still holds (how much longer she may hold it remains to be
seen) as the leading power of the world. If she has to relinquish that
position, it will only be to a power that is true to the spirit, and
is not ashamed of the name, of a republic. The nation that fully
develops the policy which pervaded the records of the English
Commonwealth will be the leader of the world. The suppression of those
records has not suppressed the spirit of popular liberty, or the
progress of mankind in the path of reform, freedom, equal rights, and
a true civilization. It has only cast a shadow, which can never wholly
be dispelled, over what otherwise would have been the brightest page
in the annals of a great people. We depend for our knowledge of the
steps by which England then made a most wonderful stride to prosperity
and power, not upon official and authoritative records, but upon the
desultory and sometimes merely gossiping memoirs of particular
persons, and such other miscellaneous materials as can be picked up.
The only consequence of an attempt to extinguish the memory of
republicans, radicals, reformers, and regicides has been, that the
history of England's true glory can never be adequately written.</p>

<p>The referees used the following language touching the point of the
ordination of Mr. Lawson: &quot;If more than a mere major part should not
consent to it, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[i.277]</a></span> should be loath to advise our brethren to proceed.&quot;
This, in connection with the other sentence I have quoted from their
communication recommending them &quot;to desist at present&quot; from urging it,
was fatal to the immediate movement in his favor; and, not seeing any
prospect of their &quot;spirits becoming better quieted and composed,&quot; and
weary of the attempt to bring them to any comfortable degree of
unanimity, Mr. Lawson threw up his connection with them, and removed
back to Boston. We shall meet him again; but it is well to despatch at
this point what is to be said of his character and history.</p>

<p>It is evident that Deodat Lawson had received the best education of
his day. It is not easy to account for his not having left a more
distinguished mark in Old or New England. He had much learning and
great talents. Of his power in getting up pulpit performances in the
highest style of eloquence, of which that period afforded remarkable
specimens, I shall have occasion to speak. Among his other
attainments, he was, what cannot be said of learned and professional
men generally now any more than then, an admirable penman. The village
parish adopted the practice at the beginning, when paying the salaries
of its ministers from time to time, instead of taking receipts on
detached and loose pieces of paper, of having them write them out in
their own hand on the pages of the record-book, with their signatures.
It is a luxury, in looking over the old volume, to come upon the
receipts of Deodat Lawson, in his plain, round hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[i.278]</a></span> A specimen is
given among the <a href="#autographs">autographs</a>. His chirography is easy, free, graceful,
clear, and clean. It unites with wonderful taste the highest degrees
of simplicity and ornament. Each style is used, and both are blended,
as occasion required. During his ministry, the trouble about the old
record-book occurred. The first four pages of the new book are in his
handwriting. The ink has somewhat faded; the paper has become
discolored, and, around the margins and at the bottom of the leaves,
lamentably worn and broken. The first page exhibits Lawson's
penmanship in its various styles. It is artistically executed in
several sizes of letters, appropriate to the position of the clauses
and the import and weight of the matter. In each there is an elegant
combination of ornament and simplicity. His chirography was often had
in requisition; and papers, evidently from his pen, are on file in
various cases, occurring in court at the time, in which his friends
were interested.</p>

<p>The first four ministers of the village parish were excellent penmen.
Bayley's hand is more like the modern style than the rest. Burroughs's
is as legible as print, uniform in its character, open and upright.
The specimen among the <a href="#autographs">autographs</a> is from the record referred to at
the top of <a href="#Page_262">page 262</a>. As it was written at the bottom of a page in the
record-book, where there was hardly sufficient room, it had to be in a
slanting line. I give it just as it there appears. Parris wrote three
different hands, all perfectly easy to read. The larger kind was used
when signing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[i.281]</a></span> name to important papers, or in brief entries of
record. The specimen I give is from a receipt in the parish-book,
which Thomas Putnam, as clerk, made oath in court, that Parris wrote
and signed in his presence. His notes of examinations of persons
charged with witchcraft by the committing magistrate, many of which
are preserved, are in his smallest hand, very minute, but always
legible. In his church-records he uses sometimes a medium hand, and
sometimes the smallest. The <a href="#autographs">autographs</a> of Townsend Bishop and Thomas
Putnam show the handwriting that seems to have prevailed among
well-educated people in England at the time of the first settlement of
this country. There was often a profusion of flourishes that obscured
the letters. The initial capitals were quite complicated and very
curious. The signature of Thomas Putnam, Jr., exhibits his excellent
handwriting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[i.279]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a name="autographs"><img src="images1/image10.png" alt="autographs" width="251" height="400" /></a></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="images1/image11.png" alt="autographs" width="252" height="400" /></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>I have adduced these facts and given these illustrations to show,
that, in this branch of education,&#8212;the value and desirableness of
which cannot be overrated,&#8212;it is at least an open question, whether
we have much ground to boast of being in advance of the first
generations of our ancestors in America. The early ministers of the
Salem Village parish certainly compare, in this particular, favorably
with ministers and professional men, and recording officers generally
in public bodies of all kinds, in later times.</p>

<p>Sergeant Thomas Putnam did not act as clerk of the parish from April,
1687, to April, 1694. A few entries are made by his hand; but the
record, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[i.282]</a></span> meagre and fragmentary, is for the most part made by
others. This is much to be regretted, as the interval covers the very
period of our history. His time, probably, was taken up, and his mind
wholly engrossed, by an unhappy family difficulty, in which, during
that period, he was involved. Thomas Putnam Sr. died, as has been
stated, in 1686. It was thought, by the children of his first wife,
that the influence of the second wife had been unduly exercised over
him, in his last years, so as to induce him to make a will giving to
her, and her only child by him, Joseph, a very unfair proportion of
his estate. It was felt by them to be so unjust that they attempted to
break the will. The management of the case was confided to Sergeant
Thomas Putnam, as the eldest son of the family; and the affair, it may
be supposed, absorbed his thoughts to such a degree as to render it
necessary for him to abandon his services as clerk of the parish. The
attempt to set aside the will failed. The circumstances connected with
the subject disturbed very seriously&#8212;perhaps permanently&#8212;the
happiness of the whole family, and may have contributed to create the
morbid excitement which afterwards was so fearfully displayed by the
wife of the younger Thomas.</p>

<p>While Mr. Lawson was at the village, he lost his wife and daughter. In
1690, he was again married, to Deborah Allen. He was settled
afterwards over the Second Society in Scituate,&#8212;it is singular that
our local histories do not tell us when, but that we get all we know
on the point from a sentence written by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[i.283]</a></span> pen on a leaf of one of
the two folio volumes of John Quick's &quot;Synodicon in Gallia Reformata,&quot;
in the possession of a gentleman in this country, Henry M. Dexter, who
says it is evidently Quick's autograph. It is in these words: &quot;For my
reverend and dear brother, Mr. Lawson, minister of the gospel, and
pastor of the church of Scituate, in the province of Massachusetts in
New England; from the publisher, John Quick, <i>honoris et amoris ergo</i>,
Aug. 6, 1693.&quot; In 1696, Mr. Lawson went over to England, merely for a
short visit, as his people supposed. They heard from him no more. He
never asked a dismission, or communicated with them in any way. In
1698, an ecclesiastical council declared them free to settle another
minister, which they did in due time. He was, no doubt, alive and in
London when, in 1704, his famous Salem Village sermon was reprinted
there. But this is the last glimpse we have of him. An inscrutable
mystery covers the rest of his history. His manner of leaving the
Scituate parish shows him to have been an eccentric person, leaves an
unfavorable impression of his character, and is as inexplicable as the
only other reference to him that has thus far been found. Calamy, in
his &quot;Continuation of the Account of Ejected Ministers,&quot; published in
1727, has a notice of Thomas Lawson, whom he describes as minister of
Denton in the county of Norfolk, educated at Katherine Hall in
Cambridge, and afterwards chosen &quot;to a fellowship in St. John's. He
was a man of parts, but had no good utterance. He was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[i.284]</a></span> father of
the unhappy Mr. Deodat Lawson, who came hither from New England.&quot; With
all his abilities, learning, and eloquence, he disappears, after the
re-publication of his Salem Village sermon in London, in the dark,
impenetrable cloud of this expression, &quot;the unhappy Mr. Deodat
Lawson.&quot; Of the melancholy fate implied in the language of Calamy, I
have not been able to obtain the slightest information.</p>

<p>The troubles that covered the whole period, since the beginning of Mr.
Bayley's ministry, had led to the neglect and derangement of the
entire organization of the Village, and resulted in the loss of what
little opportunities for education might otherwise have been provided.
So great was this evil regarded, that the old town felt it necessary
to interpose; and we find it voted Jan. 24, 1682, that &quot;Lieutenant
John Putnam is desired, and is hereby empowered, to take care that the
law relating to the catechising of children and youth be duly attended
at the Village.&quot; He is also &quot;desired to have a diligent care that all
the families do carefully and constantly attend the due education of
their children and youth according to law.&quot; We cannot but feel that
the man who was ready to fight the &quot;Topsfield men&quot; in the woods&#8212;who,
when they asked him, &quot;What, by violence?&quot; answered, with axe in hand,
&quot;Ay, by violence,&quot; and who figured in the manner described in the
scene with Mr. Burroughs&#8212;was a singular person to intrust with the
charge of &quot;catechising the children and youth.&quot; But those were queer
times, and he was a queer character. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[i.285]</a></span> had always been a
church-member; and, to the day of his death, church and prayer
meetings were more frequently held at his house than in any other. He
was a rough man, but he was no hypocrite. He was in the front of every
encounter; but he was tolerant, too, of difference of opinion. When,
at one time, the contests of the Village were at their height, and two
committees were raised representing the two conflicting parties, he
was at the head of one, and his eldest son (Jonathan) of the other.
Their opposition does not seem to have alienated them. While I have
found it necessary to hold him up, in some of his actions, for
condemnation, there were many good points about him; although he was
not the sort of man that would be likely, in our times, to be selected
to execute the functions of a Sunday-school teacher.</p>

<p>During all this period, there was a variety of minor controversies
among themselves, causing greater or less disturbance. Joseph
Hutchinson, who had given a site out of his homestead-grounds for the
meeting-house, had no patience with their perpetual wranglings. He
fenced up his lands around the meeting-house lot, leaving them an
entrance on the end towards the road. They went to court about it, and
he was called to account by the usual process of law. The plain, gruff
old farmer, who seems all along to have been a man of strong sense and
decided character, filed an answer, which is unsurpassed for bluntness
of expression. It has no language of ceremony, but goes to the point
at once. It has a general inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[i.286]</a></span>est as showing, to how late a period
the inhabitants of this neighborhood were exposed to Indian attacks,
and what means of defence were resorted to by the Village worshippers.
The document manifests the contempt in which he held the complainants,
and it was all the satisfaction they got.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Joseph Hutchinson his answer is as followeth:&#8212;</p>

<p>&quot;First, as to the covenant they spoke of, I conceive it is
neither known of by me nor them, as will appear by records
from the farmer's book.</p>

<p>&quot;Second, I conceive they have no cause to complain of me for
fencing in my own land; for I am sure I fenced in none of
theirs. I wish they would not pull down my fences. I am
loath to complain, though I have just cause.</p>

<p>&quot;Third, for blocking up the meeting-house, it was they did
it, and not I, in the time of the Indian wars; and they made
Salem pay for it. I wish they would bring me my rocks they
took to do it with; for I want them to make fence with.</p>

<p>&quot;Thus, hoping this honored Court will see that there was no
just cause to complain against me, and their cause will
appear unjust in that they would in an unjust way take away
my land, I trust I shall have relief; so I rest, your
Honor's servant,</p>

<p>[Nov. 27, 1686.]</p></div>

<p>The next minister of Salem Village brought matters to a crisis. Samuel
Parris is stated to have been a son of Thomas Parris, of London, and
was born in 1653. He was, for a time, a member of Harvard College, but
did not finish the academic course, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[i.287]</a></span> drawn to a commercial life.
He was engaged in the West-India business, and probably lived at
Barbadoes. After a while, he abandoned commerce, and prepared himself
for the ministry. There was at this time, and long subsequently, a
very particular mercantile connection between Salem and Barbadoes. The
former husband of the wife of Thomas Putnam, Sr.,&#8212;Nathaniel
Veren,&#8212;as has been stated, had property in that island, and was more
or less acquainted with its people. Perhaps it was through this
channel that the thoughts of the people of the Village were turned
towards Mr. Parris. From a deposition made by him a few years
afterwards in a suit at law between him and his parishioners, we learn
some interesting facts relating to the negotiations that led to his
settlement.</p>

<p>It appears from his statement that a committee, consisting of &quot;Captain
John Putnam, Mr. Joshua Rea, Sr., and Francis Nurse,&quot; was appointed,
on the 15th of November, 1688, to treat with him &quot;about taking
ministerial office.&quot; On the 25th of November, &quot;after the services in
the afternoon, the audience was stayed, and, by a general vote,
requested Mr. Parris to take office.&quot; He hung back for a while, and
exercised the skill and adroitness acquired in his mercantile life in
making as sharp a bargain as he could.</p>

<p>At that time, there appeared to be a degree of harmony among the
people, such as they had never known before. There was a disposition
on all sides to come together, and avail themselves of the occasion
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[i.288]</a></span> settling a new minister, to bury their past animosities, and
forget their grievances; and there is every reason to believe, if Mr.
Parris had promptly closed with their terms, he might have enjoyed a
peaceful ministry, and a happy oblivion have covered for ever his name
and the history of the village. But he withheld response to the call.
The people were impatient, and felt that the golden opportunity might
be lost, and the old feuds revive. On the 10th of December, another
committee was raised, consisting of Lieutenant Nathaniel Putnam,
Sergeant Fuller, Mr. Joshua Rea, Sr., and Sergeant Ingersoll, as
&quot;messengers, to know whether Mr. Parris would accept of office.&quot; His
answer was, &quot;the work was weighty; they should know in due time.&quot; They
were thus kept in suspense during the whole winter, getting no reply
from him. On the 29th of April, 1689, &quot;Deacons Nathaniel Ingersoll and
Edward Putnam, Daniel Rea, Thomas Fuller, Jr., and John Tarbell, came
to Mr. Parris from the meeting-house,&quot; where there had been a general
meeting of the inhabitants, and said, &quot;Being the aged men had had the
matter of Mr. Parris's settlement so long in hand, and effected
nothing, they were desirous to try what the younger could do.&quot; Deacon
Ingersoll was about fifty-five years of age; but his spirit and
character kept him in sympathy with the progressive impulses of
younger men. Deacon Putnam was thirty-four years of age. Daniel Rea
was the son of Joshua; Thomas Fuller, Jr., the son of Sergeant Fuller;
and John Tarbell, the son-in-law of Francis Nurse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[i.289]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the first appearance, I believe, in our history, of that
notorious and most pretentious personage who has figured so largely in
all our affairs ever since, &quot;Young America.&quot; The sequel shows, that,
in this instance at least, no benefit arose from discarding the
caution and experience of years. The &quot;younger men&quot; were determined to
&quot;go ahead.&quot; They said they were desirous of a speedy answer. Finding
them in a temper to &quot;finish the thing up,&quot; at any rate, and seeing
that they were ambitious to get the credit of &quot;effecting something,&quot;
and, for that end, predisposed to come to his terms, he disclosed
them. They had offered him a salary of sixty pounds per annum,&#8212;one
third in money, the rest in provisions, at certain specified rates. He
agreed to accept the call on the foregoing terms, with certain
additional conditions thus described by himself: &quot;First, when money
shall be more plenteous, the money part to be paid me shall
accordingly be increased. Second, though corn or like provisions
should arise to a higher price than you have set, yet, for my own
family use, I shall have what is needful at the price now stated, and
so if it fall lower. Third, the whole sixty pounds to be only from our
inhabitants that are dwelling in our bounds, proportionable to what
lands they have within the same. Fourth, no provision to be brought in
without first asking whether needed, and myself to make choice of
what, unless the person is unable to pay in any sort but one. Fifth,
firewood to be given in yearly, freely. Sixth, two men to be chosen
yearly to see that due payments be made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[i.290]</a></span> Seventh, contributions each
sabbath in papers; and only such as are in papers, and dwelling within
our bounds, to be accounted a part of the sixty pounds. Eighth, as God
shall please to bless the place so as to be able to rise higher than
the sixty pounds, that then a proportionable increase be made. If God
shall please, for our sins, to diminish the substance of said place, I
will endeavor accordingly to bear such losses, by proportionable
abatements of such as shall reasonably desire it.&quot;</p>

<p>A contribution-box was either handed around by the deacons, before the
congregation was dismissed, or attached permanently near the porch or
door. Rate-payers would inclose their money in papers, with their
names, and drop them in. When the box was opened, the sums inclosed
would be entered to their credit on the rate-schedule. There was
always a considerable number of stated worshippers in the congregation
who lived without the bounds of the village, and often transient
visitors or strangers happened to be at meeting. It was a point that
had not been determined, whether moneys collected from the above
descriptions of persons should go into the general treasury of the
parish, to be used in meeting their contract to pay the minister's
salary, or be kept as a separate surplus.</p>

<p>The terms, as thus described by Mr. Parris, show that he had profited
by his experience in trade, and knew how to make a shrewd bargain. It
was quite certain that a farming community in a new country, with
fields continually reclaimed from the wilderness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[i.291]</a></span> added to
culture, would increase in substance: if so, his annual stipend would
increase. If the place should decline, he was to abate the tax of
individuals, if desired by them personally, so far as he should judge
their petition to that effect reasonable. If &quot;strangers' money,&quot; or
contributions from &quot;outsiders,&quot; were not to go to make up his sixty
pounds, it was quite probable that it would come into his pocket as an
extra allowance, or perquisite.</p>

<p>He says that the committee accepted these terms, and agreed to them,
expressing their belief that the people also would. No record appears
on the parish-books of the appointment of this committee of the
&quot;younger men,&quot; or of the action of the society on their report, or of
any report having been made at that time. In the mean while, Mr.
Parris continued to preach and act as the minister of the society
until his ordination, near the close of the year. There was a meeting
on the 21st of May; but the record consists of but a single
entry,&#8212;the appointment of a committee &quot;as overseers for the year
ensuing, to take care of our meeting-house and other public charges,
and to make return according to law.&quot; The next entry is of a general
meeting of the inhabitants, on the 18th of June, 1689. The choice of
the regular standing committee for the year is recorded. Immediately
following this entry, are these words:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;At the same meeting,&#8212;the 18th of June, 1689,&#8212;it was
agreed and voted by general concurrence, that, for Mr.
Parris, his encouragement and settlement in the work of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[i.292]</a></span>
ministry amongst us, we will give him sixty six pounds for
his yearly salary,&#8212;one-third paid in money, the other
two-third parts for provisions, &amp;c.; and Mr. Parris to find
himself firewood, and Mr. Parris to keep the ministry-house
in good repair; and that Mr. Parris shall also have the use
of the ministry-pasture, and the inhabitants to keep the
fence in repair; and that we will keep up our contributions,
and our inhabitants to put their money in papers, and this
to continue so long as Mr. Parris continues in the work of
the ministry amongst us, and all productions to be good and
merchantable. And, if it please God to bless the
inhabitants, we shall be willing to give more; and to
expect, that if God shall diminish the estates of the
people, that then Mr. Parris do abate of his salary
according to proportion.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Comparing this record with the account given by Mr. Parris of the
eight conditions upon which he agreed, in conference with the
committee of the &quot;younger&quot; sort, on the 29th of April, to accept the
call of the parish, the difference is not very essential. The matter
of firewood was arranged, according to his account, by mutual
agreement, they to add six pounds to his salary, and he to find his
own wood. The rates of &quot;the inhabitants&quot; were to be paid &quot;in papers.&quot;
The only point of difference, touching this matter, is that the record
is silent about contributions by outsiders and strangers; whereas he
says it was agreed, on the 29th of April, that they should not go
towards making up his salary. The idea of his salary rising with the
growth and sinking with the decline of the society is expressed in the
record<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[i.293]</a></span> substantially as it is by him, only it is made exact; and, in
case of a decline in the means of the people, a corresponding decline
is to be in the aggregate of his salary, and not by abatements made by
him in individual cases. The variations are nearly, if not quite, all
unimportant in their nature, and such as a regard to mutual
convenience would suggest. Yet there was something in the above record
which highly exasperated Mr. Parris.</p>

<p>In his deposition he states, that, at a meeting held on the 17th of
May, of which there is no record in the parish book, he was sent for
and was present. He says that there was &quot;much agitation&quot; at the
meeting. He says that objection was made by the people to two of his
&quot;eight&quot; conditions, the fifth and seventh. But there is nothing in the
record of the 18th of June in conflict with what he says was finally
agreed upon, except the disposition that should be made of &quot;strangers'
money.&quot; The question then recurs, What was the cause of the &quot;much
agitation&quot; at that meeting? What was it in the language of that record
which always so excited Mr. Parris's wrath?</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the offensive words were those which
require &quot;Mr. Parris to keep the ministry house in good repair,&quot; and
that he &quot;shall also have the use of the ministry pasture;&quot; and this
was not objectionable as involving any expense upon him, but solely
because the language employed precluded the supposition that the
parish had countenanced the idea of ever conveying the parsonage and
parsonage lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[i.294]</a></span> to him in his own right and absolutely. This was an
object which he evidently had in view from the first, and to which he
clung to the last. It is to be feared, that some of the members of the
&quot;Young-America&quot; committee, in their heedless and inconsiderate
eagerness to &quot;effect&quot; something, to settle Mr. Parris forthwith, and
thereby prove how much more competent they were than &quot;the aged men&quot; to
transact a weighty business, had encouraged Mr. Parris to think that
his favorite object could be accomplished. Upon a little inquiry,
however, they discovered that it could not be done; but that the house
and land were secured by the original deeds of conveyance, and by
irreversible agreements and conditions, to the use of the ministry,
for the time being and for ever. So far as the committee or any of its
members had favored this idea in their conference with Mr. Parris,
they had taken a position from which they had to retreat. They had
compromised themselves and the parish. For this reason, perhaps, they
made no report; and no mention of their agency appears on the records.
How far Deacon Ingersoll was misled by his younger associates on this
occasion, I know not; but he was not a man to break a promise if he
could keep it, no matter how much to his own loss. He recognized his
responsibility as chairman of the unfortunate committee, and retrieved
the mistake they had made, by giving to Mr. Parris, by deed, a lot of
land adjoining the parsonage property, and in value equal to the whole
of it. The date of that conveyance, immediately after Mr. Parris's
ordination, corroborates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[i.295]</a></span> the conjecture that it was made to
compensate Mr. Parris for the failure of his expectation to get
possession of the ministry property. It ought to have been received by
him as an equivalent, and have soothed his angry disappointment; but
it did not. He had indulged the belief, that he had effected a bargain
with the parish, at his settlement, which had made him the owner, in
fee simple, of the parish property; and when he found that the record
of the terms of his settlement, in the parish-book, absolutely
precluded that idea, his exasperation was great, and no reparation
Deacon Ingersoll or any one else could make was suffered to appease
it. The following deposition, made in court some years afterwards,
gives an account of a scene in the meeting-house after Parris's
ordination:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Ipswich Court</span>, 1697.&#8212;Parris <i>versus</i> Inhabitants
of Salem Village.</p>

<p>&quot;We the undersigned testify and say, that, a considerable
time after Mr. Parris his ordination, there was a meeting of
the inhabitants of Salem Village at the usual place of
meeting; and the occasion of the meeting was concerning Mr.
Parris, and several persons were at that meeting, that had
not, before this meeting, joined with the people in calling
or agreeing with Mr. Parris; and the said persons desired
that those things that concerned Mr. Parris and the people
might be read, and accordingly it was. And the entry, that
some call a salary, being read, there arose a difference
among the people, the occasion of which was finding an entry
in the book of the Village records, relating to Mr. Parris
his maintenance, which was dated the 18th of June,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[i.296]</a></span> 1689;
and, the entry being read to the people, some replied that
they believed that Mr. Parris would not comply with that
entry; whereupon one said it was best to send for Mr. Parris
to resolve the question. Accordingly, he was sent for. He
coming to the people, this entry of the 18th of June, 1689,
was read to Mr. Parris. His answer was as follows: 'He never
heard or knew any thing of it, neither could or would he
take up with it, or any part of it;' and further he said,
'They were knaves and cheaters that entered it.' And
Lieutenant Nathaniel Putnam, being moderator of that
meeting, replied to Mr. Parris, and said, 'Sir, then there
is only proposals on both sides, and no agreement between
you and the people.' And Mr. Parris answered and said, 'No
more, there is not; for I am free from the people, and the
people free from me:' and so the meeting broke up. And we
further testify, that there hath not been any agreement made
with Mr. Parris, that we knew of or ever heard of,&#8212;never
since.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Sworn in Court, at Ipswich, April 13, 1697, by all three.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Attest, <span class="smcap">Stephen Sewall</span>, <i>Clerk</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The answer which Mr. Parris made to Nathaniel Putnam's inquiry
probably settled the question in the suit then pending, and led to the
final release of the parish from him. It is hard to find any point of
difference between his own account of the conditions he himself made,
and the record of the parish-book, of sufficient importance to account
for the storm of passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[i.297]</a></span> into which the reading of the latter drove
him, except in the language which I have suggested as the probable
occasion of his wrath. Unfortunately for him, there is evidence quite
corroborative of this suggestion.</p>

<p>The parish-book has the following record:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;At a general meeting of the inhabitants of Salem Village,
Oct. 10, 1689, it was agreed and voted, that the vote, in
our book of record of 1681, that lays, as some say, an
entailment upon our ministry house and land, is hereby made
void and of no effect; one man only dissenting.</p>

<p>&quot;It was voted and agreed by a general concurrence, that we
will give to Mr. Parris our ministry house and barn, and two
acres of land next adjoining to the house; and that Mr.
Parris take office amongst us, and live and die in the work
of the ministry among us; and, if Mr. Parris or his heirs do
sell the house and land, that the people may have the first
refusal of it, by giving as much as other men will. A
committee was chosen to lay out the land, and make a
conveyance of the house and land, and to make the conveyance
in the name and in the behalf of the inhabitants unto Mr.
Parris and his heirs.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The record of these votes is not signed by the clerk, and there is no
evidence that the meeting was legally warned. It does not appear in
whose custody the book then was. But, however the entry got in, it
proves that Parris's friends were determined to gratify his all but
insane purpose to get possession of what he ought to have known it was
impossible for the parish to give, or for him or his heirs to hold. It
was indeed a miserable commencement of his ministry, to introduce
such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[i.298]</a></span> a strife with a people who really seem to have had an earnest
desire to receive him with united hearts, and make his settlement and
ministry the harbinger of a better day. But he alienated many of them,
at the very start, by his sharp practice in negotiating about the
pecuniary details of his agreement with the parish. When, after all
their care to prevent it, it became known that somehow or other a vote
had got upon the records, conveying to him outright their ministerial
property, there was great indignation; and a determined effort was
made to recover what they declared to be &quot;a fraudulent conveying-away&quot;
of the property of the society.</p>

<p>A more violent conflict than any before was let loose upon that
devoted people. The old passions were rekindled. Men ranged themselves
as the friends and opponents of Mr. Parris in bitter antagonism. Rates
were not collected; the meeting-house went into dilapidation;
complaints were made to the County Court; orders were issued to
collect rates, but they were disregarded; and all was confusion,
disorder, and contention.</p>

<p>A church was organized in connection with the village parish, and Mr.
Parris ordained on Monday, Nov. 19, 1689. The covenant adopted was the
&quot;confession of faith owned and consented unto by the elders and
messengers of the churches assembled at Boston, New England, May 12,
1680.&quot; In the library of the Connecticut Historical Society, there is
a manuscript volume of sermons and abstracts of sermons preached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[i.299]</a></span> by
Mr. Parris between November, 1689, and May, 1694. It begins with his
ordination sermon, which has this prefix: &quot;My poor and weak ordination
sermon, at the embodying of a church at Salem Village on the 19th of
the ninth month, 1689, the Rev. Mr. Nicholas Noyes embodying of us;
who also ordained my most unworthy self pastor, and, together with the
Rev. Mr. Samuel Phillips and the Rev. Mr. John Hale, imposed
hands,&#8212;the same Mr. Phillips giving me the right hand of fellowship
with beautiful loveliness and humility.&quot; The text is from Josh. v. 9:
&quot;And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
reproach of Egypt from off you.&quot;</p>

<p>The first entry in the church-records, after the covenant and the
names of the members, is the following: &quot;Nov. 24, 1689.&#8212;Sab: day.
Brother Nathaniel Ingersoll chosen, by a general vote of the brethren,
to officiate in the place of a deacon for a time.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Parris commenced his administration by showing that he meant to
exercise the disciplinary powers intrusted to him, as pastor of a
church, with a high hand, and without much regard to persons or
circumstances. Ezekiel Cheever had been a member of the mother-church
in Salem twenty years before, was one of the founders of the parish
church, and appears to have been a worthy and amiable person,
occupying and owning the farm of his uncle, Captain Lothrop. On the
sudden illness of a member of his family, being &quot;in distress for a
horse,&quot; none of his own being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[i.300]</a></span> available at the time, he rushed, in
his hurry and alarm, to the stable of a neighbor, took one of his
horses, &quot;without leave or asking of it,&quot; and rode, post haste, for a
doctor. One would have thought that an affair of this sort, in such an
exigency, might have been left to neighborly explanation or
adjustment. But Mr. Parris regarded it as giving a good opportunity
for an exercise of power that would strike the terrors of discipline
home upon the whole community. About five or six weeks after the
occurrence, Cheever was dealt with in the manner thus described by Mr.
Parris, in his church-record, dated &quot;Sab: 30 March, 1690.&quot; He was
&quot;called forth to give satisfaction to the offended church, as also the
last sabbath he was called forth for the same purpose; but then he
failed in giving satisfaction, by reason of somewhat mincing in the
latter part of his confession, which, in the former, he had more
ingenuously acknowledged: but this day, the church received
satisfaction, as was testified by their holding-up of their hands;
and, after the whole, a word of caution by the pastor was dropped upon
the offender in particular, and upon us all in general.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Parris was evidently inclined to magnify the importance of the
church, and to get it into such a state of subserviency to his
authority, that he could wield it effectually as a weapon in his fight
with the congregation. With this view, he endeavored to render the
action of the church as dignified and imposing as possible; to enlarge
and expand its ceremonial proceedings, and make it the theatre for the
exercise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[i.301]</a></span> his authority as its head and ruler. This feature of his
policy was so strikingly illustrated in the course he took in
reference to the deacons, that I must present it as recorded by him in
the church-book. It is worth preserving as a curiosity in
ecclesiastical administration.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Ingersoll had been a professor of religion almost as long as
Mr. Parris had lived. He was eminently a Christian man, of
acknowledged piety, and beloved and revered by all. He had been the
patron, benefactor, and guardian of the parish and all its interests
from its formation. He had long held the title of deacon, and
exercised the functions of that office so far as they could be
exercised previous to the organization of a church. He had been the
almoner of the charities of the people, and their adviser and
religious friend in all things. He was approaching the boundaries of
advanced years, and already recognized among the fathers of the
community. It would have seemed no more than what all might have
expected, to have had him recognized as a deacon of the church, in
full standing, at the first. It was, no doubt, what all did expect.
But no: he must be put upon probation. He was chosen deacon &quot;for the
present&quot; in November, 1689. Mr. Parris kept the matter of confirmation
hanging in his own hands for a year and a half. The appointment of the
other deacon was kept suspended for a full year. On the 30th of
November, 1690, there is the following entry:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[i.302]</a></span>&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;This evening, after the public service was over, the church
was, by the pastor, desired to stay, and then by him Brother
Edward Putnam was propounded as a meet person for to be
chosen as another deacon. The issue whereof was, that, it
being now an excessive cold day, some did propose that
another season might be pitched upon for discourse thereof.
Whereupon the pastor mentioned the next fourth day, at two
of the clock, at the pastor's house, for further discourse
thereof; to which the church agreed by not dissenting.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The record of the proceedings on the &quot;next fourth day&quot; is as
follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;3 December, 1690.&#8212;This afternoon, at a church meeting
appointed the last sabbath, Brother Edward Putnam was again
propounded to the church for choice to office in the place
of a deacon to join with, and be assistant to, Brother
Ingersoll in the service, and in order to said Putnam's
ordination in the office, upon his well approving himself
therein. Some proposed that two might be nominated to the
church, out of which the church to choose one. But arguments
satisfactory were produced against that way. Some also moved
for a choice by papers; but that way also was disapproved by
the arguments of the pastor and some others. In fine, the
pastor put it to vote (there appearing not the least
exception from any, unless a modest and humble exception of
the person himself, once and again), and it was carried in
the affirmative by a universal vote, <i>nemine non
suffragante</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;Afterwards, the pastor addressed himself to the elected
brother, and, in the name of the church, desired his answer,
who replied to this purpose:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[i.303]</a></span>&#8212;</p>

<p>'Seeing, sir, you say the voice of God's people is the voice
of God, desiring your prayers and the prayers of the church
for divine assistance therein, I do accept of the call.'&quot;</p></div>

<p>When we consider that Edward Putnam was, at Mr. Parris's ordination
more than a year before, and had been for some time previous to that
event, Ingersoll's associate deacon, and that there probably never was
any other person spoken or thought of than these two for deacons, it
is evident that it was Mr. Parris's policy to make a great matter of
the affair, and produce a general feeling of the weighty importance of
church action in the premises. But this was only the beginning of the
long-drawn ceremonial solemnities by which the occasion was magnified.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Sab: day, 7 December, 1690.&#8212;After the evening public
service was over, several things needful were transacted;
viz.:&#8212;</p>

<p>&quot;1. The pastor acquainted those of the church that were
ignorant of it, that Brother Edward Putnam was chosen deacon
the last church meeting.</p>

<p>&quot;2. He also generally admonished those of the brethren that
were absent at that time, of their disorderliness therein,
telling them that such, the apostle bids, should be noted or
marked (2 Thess. iii. 6-16); that is, with a church mark,&#8212;a
mark in a disciplinary way; and therefore begged amendment
for the future in that point and to that purpose.</p>

<p>&quot;3. He propounded whether they so far were satisfied in
Brother Ingersoll's service as to call him to settlement in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[i.304]</a></span>
the deaconship by ordination, or had aught against it. But
no brother made personal exception. Therefore, it being put
to vote, it was carried in the affirmative by a plurality,
if not universality.</p>

<p>&quot;4. The Lord's Table, not being provided for with aught else
but two pewter tankards, the pastor propounded and desired
that the next sacrament-day, which is to be the 21st
instant, there be a more open and liberal contribution by
the communicants, that so the deacons may have wherewith to
furnish the said table decently; which was consented to.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The last clause, &quot;which was consented to,&quot; is in a smaller hand than
the rest of the record. It was written by Mr. Parris, but apparently
some time afterwards, and with fainter ink. There is reason to suppose
that nothing was accomplished at that time in the way of getting rid
of the &quot;pewter tankards.&quot; The farmers were too hard pressed by taxes
imposed by the province, and by the weight of local assessments, to
listen to fanciful appeals. They probably continued for some time, and
perhaps until after receiving Deacon Ingersoll's legacy, in 1720, to
get along as they were. They did not believe, that, in order to
approach the presence, and partake of the memorials, of the Saviour,
it was necessary to bring vessels of silver or gold. In their
circumstances, gathered in their humble rustic edifice for worship,
they did not feel that, in the sight of the Lord, costly furniture
would add to the adornment of his table.</p>

<p>Nearly six months after Putnam's election, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[i.305]</a></span> Parris brought up the
matter again at a meeting of the church, on the 31st of May, 1691, and
made a speech relating to it, which he entered on the records thus:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;The pastor spoke to the brethren to this purpose, viz.:&#8212;</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Brethren</span>,&#8212;The ordination of Brother Ingersoll has
already been voted a good while since, and I thought to have
consummated the affair a good time since, but have been put
by, by diversity of occurrents; and, seeing it is so long
since, I think it needless to make two works of one, and
therefore intend the ordination of Brother Putnam together
with Brother Ingersoll in the deaconship, if you continue in
the same mind as when you elected him: therefore, if you are
so, let a vote manifest it. Voted by all, or at least the
most. I observed none that voted not.&quot;</p></div>

<p>At last the mighty work was accomplished. Deacon Ingersoll had been on
probation for eighteen months from the date of his election, which
took place five days after Mr. Parris's ordination. His final
induction to office was observed with great formality, and in the
presence of the whole congregation. Mr. Parris enters the order of
performances in the church records as follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Sab: 28 June, 1691.&#8212;After the afternoon sermon upon 1 Tim.
iii. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, as the brethren had renewed their
call of Brother Ingersoll to the office of a deacon, and he
himself had declared his acceptance, the pastor proceeded to
ordain him, using the form following:</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Beloved Brother</span>, God having called you to the
office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[i.306]</a></span> of a deacon by the choice of the brethren and your
own acceptance, and that call being now to be consummated
according to the primitive pattern, 6 Acts 6, by prayer and
imposition of hands,&#8212;</p>

<p>&quot;We do, therefore, by this solemnity, declare your
investiture into that office, solemnly charging you in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of his Church, who
walks in the midst of his golden candlesticks, with eyes as
of a flame of fire, exactly observing the demeanor of all in
his house, both officers and members, that you labor so to
carry it, as to evidence you are sanctified by grace,
qualified for this work, and to grow in those
qualifications; behaving of yourself gravely, sincerely,
temperately, with due care for the government of your own
house, holding the mystery of the faith in a pure
conscience; that as they in this office are called 'helps,'
so you be helpful in your place and capacity, doing what is
your part for the promoting of the work of Christ here. We
do charge you, that, whatever you do in this office, you do
it faithfully, giving with simplicity, showing mercy with
cheerfulness. Look on it, brother, as matter of care, and
likewise of encouragement, that both the office itself and
also your being set up in it is of God, who, being waited
upon, will be with you, and accept you therein, assisting
you to use the office of a deacon well, so as that you may
be blameless, purchasing to yourself a good degree and great
boldness in the faith.</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&#8212;That Brother Putnam was not yet willing to
be ordained, but desired further considering time, between
him and I and Brother Ingersoll, in private discourse the
week before the ordination above said.&quot;</p></div>

<p>&quot;Brother Putnam&quot; probably partook of the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[i.307]</a></span> wonder what all this
appearance of difficulty and delay, under the peculiar circumstances
of the case, meant; and being, as the record truly says, a modest and
humble man, he naturally shrank from the formidable ceremoniousness
and pretentious parade with which Mr. Parris surrounded the
transaction. At any rate, he hesitated long before he was willing to
encounter it. It is probable that he positively refused to have his
induction to the office heralded with such solemn pomp. There is no
mention of his public ordination, which Mr. Parris would not have
omitted to record, had any such scene occurred. All we know is that he
was recognized as deacon forthwith, and held the office for forty
years.</p>

<p>The disposition of Mr. Parris to make use of his office, as the head
of the church, to multiply occasions for the exercise of his
influence, and to gain control over the minds of the brethren, is
apparent throughout his records. He raised objections in order to show
how he could remove them, and started difficulties about matters which
had not before been brought into question. In the beginning of his
ministry, he manifested this propensity. At a church meeting at John
Putnam's house, Feb. 20, 1690, less than three months after his
ordination, he threw open the whole question of baptism for discussion
among the brethren. There is no reason to suppose that their attention
had been drawn to it before. He propounded the question to the plain,
practical husbandmen, &quot;Who are the proper subjects of baptism?&quot; He
laid down the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[i.308]</a></span> doctrine, as he regarded it, in this answer,
&quot;Covenant-professing believers and their infant seed.&quot; He put the
answer to vote, and none voted against it. He then proceeded with
another question, &quot;How far may we account such seed infant seed, and
so to be baptized?&quot; Here he had got beyond their depth, and, as some
of them thought, his own too; for there was only a &quot;major vote&quot; in
favor of his answer: &quot;two or three, I think not four, dissented.&quot;
There was some danger of getting into divisions by introducing such
questions; but he managed to avoid it, so far as his church was
concerned. He worked them up to the highest confidence in his learning
and wisdom, and gained complete ascendency over them. He aggrandized
their sense of importance, and accomplished his object in securing
their support in his controversies with his congregation. The
brethren, after a while, became his devoted body-guard, and the church
a fortress of defence and assault. There is reason, however, to
believe, that the points he raised on the subject of baptism led to
perplexities, in some minds, which long continued to disturb them.
While showing off his learning, and displaying his capacity to dispose
of the deep questions of theology, he let fall seeds of division and
doubt that ripened into contention in subsequent generations. The only
ripple on the surface of the Village Church during its long record of
peace, since the close of his disastrous ministry, was occasioned by
differing opinions on this subject. It required all the wisdom of his
successors to quiet them. From time to time, formulas had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[i.309]</a></span> to be
constructed, half-way covenants of varying expressions to be framed,
to meet and dispose of the difficulties thus gratuitously raised by
him.</p>

<p>The following passages from his record-book show how he made much of a
matter which any other pastor would have quietly arranged without
calling for the intervention of church or congregation: they are also
interesting as a picture of the times:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Sab: 9 Aug. 1691.&#8212;After all public worship was over, and
the church stayed on purpose, I proposed to the church
whether they were free to admit to baptism, upon occasion,
such as were not at present free to come up to full
communion. I told them there was a young woman, by name Han:
Wilkins, the daughter of our Brother Thomas Wilkins, who
much desired to be baptized, but yet did not dare to come to
the Lord's Supper. If they had nothing against it, I should
take their silence for consent, and in due time acquaint
them with what she had offered me to my satisfaction, and
proceed accordingly.&quot;</p></div>

<p>No answer was made <i>pro</i> or <i>con</i>, and so the church was dismissed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Sab: 23 Aug. 1691.&#8212;Hannah Wilkins, aged about twenty-one
years, was called forth, and her relation read in the full
assembly, and then it was propounded to the church, that, if
they had just exceptions, or, on the other hand, had any
thing farther to encourage, they had opportunity and liberty
to speak. None said any thing but Brother Bray Wilkins (Han:
grandfather), who said, that, for all he knew, such a
relation as had been given and a conversation suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[i.310]</a></span> (as
he judged hers to be) was enough to enjoy full communion.
None else saying any thing, it was put to vote whether they
were so well satisfied as to receive this young woman into
membership, and therefore initiate her therein by baptism.
It was voted fully. Whereupon the covenant was given to her
as if she had entered into full communion. And the pastor
told her, in the name of the church, that we would expect
and wait for her rising higher, and therefore advised her to
attend all means conscientiously for that end.</p>

<p>&quot;After all, I pronounced her a member of this church, and
then baptized her.</p>

<p>&quot;28 August, 1691.&#8212;This day, Sister Hannah Wilkins aforesaid
came to me, and spake to this like effect, following:&#8212;</p>

<p>&quot;Before I was baptized (you know, sir), I was desirous of
communion at the Lord's Table, but not yet; I was afraid of
going so far: but since my baptism I find my desires growing
to the Lord's Table, and I am afraid to turn my back upon
that ordinance, or to refuse to partake thereof. And that
which moves me now to desire full communion, which I was
afraid of before, is that of Thomas, 20 John 26, &amp;c., where
he, being absent from the disciples, though but once, lost a
sight of Christ, and got more hardness of heart, or increase
of unbelief. And also those words of Ananias to Paul after
his conversion, 22 Acts 16, 'And now why tarriest thou?
Arise,' &amp;c. So I am afraid of tarrying. The present time is
only mine. And God having, beyond my deserts, graciously
opened a door, I look upon it my duty to make present
improvement of it.</p>

<p>&quot;Sab: and Sacrament Day, 30 Aug. 1691.&#8212;Sister Han:
Wilkins's motion (before the celebration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[i.311]</a></span> Lord's
Supper was begun) was mentioned or propounded to the church,
and what she said to me (before hinted) read to them, and
then their vote was called for, to answer her desire if they
saw good; whereupon the church voted in the affirmative
plentifully.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The foregoing passages illustrate Mr. Parris's propensity to magnify
the operations of the church, and to bring its movements as
conspicuously and as often as possible before the eyes of the people.
It is evident that the humble and timid scruples of this interesting
and intelligent young woman might have been met and removed by
personal conference with her pastor. As her old grandfather seemed to
think, there was no difficulty in the case whatever. The reflections
of a few days made the path plain before her. But Mr. Parris paraded
the matter on three sabbaths before the church, and on one of them at
least before the congregation. He called her to come forth, and stand
out in the presence of the &quot;full assembly.&quot; As the result of the
ordeal, she owned the covenant; the church voted her in, as to full
communion; and the pastor pronounced her a member of the church, and
baptized her as such. Her sensible conversation with him the next
Friday was evidently intended for the satisfaction of him and others,
as explaining her appearance at the next communion. But another
opportunity was offered to make a display of the case, and he could
not resist the temptation. He desired to create an impression by
reading what she had said to him in his study, before the church, if
not before the whole congregation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[i.312]</a></span> To give a show of propriety in
bringing it forward again, he felt that some action must be had upon
it; hence the vote. Accordingly, Hannah Wilkins appears by the record
to have been twice, on two successive Lord's Days, voted &quot;plentifully&quot;
into the Salem Village Church, when there was no occasion for such an
extraordinary repetition, as everybody from the first welcomed her
into it with the cordial confidence she merited. I have spread out
this proceeding to your view, not altogether from its intrinsic
interest, but because, perhaps, it affords the key to interpret the
course of this ill-starred man in his wrangles with his congregation,
and his terrible prominency in the awful scenes of the witchcraft
delusion. He seemed to have had a love of excitement that was
irrepressible, an all but insane passion for getting up a scene. When
we come to the details of our story, it will be for a charitable
judgment to determine whether this trait of his nature may not be
regarded as the cause of all the woes in which he involved others and
became involved himself.</p>

<p>The church records are, in one respect, in singular contrast with the
parish records. The latter are often silent in reference to matters of
interest at the time, which might without impropriety have been
entered in them. They are confined strictly to votes and proceedings
in legal meetings, or what purport to have been meetings legally
called; and we look in vain for comments or notices relating to
outside matters. Except when kept by Sergeant Thomas Putnam, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[i.313]</a></span> are
defective and imperfect. The church records, while made by Mr. Parris,
are full of side remarks, and touches of criticism concerning whatever
was going on. This makes them particularly interesting and valuable
now. They are composed in their author's clear, natural, and sprightly
style; and, although for the most part in an exceedingly small hand,
are legible with perfect ease, and give us a transcript, not only of
the formal doings of the church, but of the writer's mind and feelings
about matters and things in general. We gather from them by far the
greater part of all we know relating to his quarrel with his
congregation.</p>

<p>This subject constantly engrossed his thoughts. He was continually
introducing, at church meetings, complaints against the conduct of the
parish committee, and enlarging upon the wrongs he was suffering at
their hands. He took occasion on Lecture days, if not in ordinary
discourses on the Lord's Day, to give all possible circulation and
publicity to his grievances. The effect of this was, instead of
bringing his people into subjection and carrying his points against
them, to aggravate their alienation. His manner of dealing with the
difficulties of the situation into which they had been brought was
harsh and exasperating, and utterly injudicious, imprudent, and
mischievous in all its bearings, producing a condition of things truly
scandalous. His notions and methods, acquired in his mercantile life;
his haggling with the people about the terms of his salary; and his
general manner and tone, particularly so far as they had been formed
by residence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[i.314]</a></span> in West-India slave Islands,&#8212;were thoroughly
distasteful, and entirely repugnant, to the feelings, notions, ideas,
and spirit of the farmers of Salem Village. At their meetings, they
showed a continually increasing strength of opposition to him, and
were careful to appoint committees who could not be brought under his
influence, and would stand firm against all outside pressure.</p>

<p>It is quite apparent, that Mr. Parris employed his church, and the
ministerial offices generally, as engines to operate against his
opponents; and sometimes rather unscrupulously, as a collocation of
dates and entries shows. A meeting of the parish was warned to be held
Oct. 16, 1691. It was important to bring his machinery to bear upon
the feelings of the people, so as to strengthen the hands of his
friends at that meeting. The following entry is in the church-book,
dated 8th October, 1691: &quot;Being my Lecture-day, after public service
was ended, I was so bare of firewood, that I was forced publicly to
desire the inhabitants to take care that I might be provided for;
telling them, that, had it not been for Mr. Corwin (who had bought
wood, being then at my house), I should hardly have any to burn.&quot;
According to his own account, as we have seen, it had been arranged,
by mutual agreement, that he was to provide his own firewood, six
pounds per annum having been added to his salary for that purpose. He
selected that item as one of the necessaries of which he was in want,
probably because, as the winter was approaching, it would be the best
point on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[i.315]</a></span> which to appeal to the public sympathies, and get up a
clamor against his opponents.</p>

<p>The parish meeting was duly held on the 16th of October. Mr. Parris's
speech, at the preceding Lecture-day, about &quot;firewood,&quot; was found not
to have produced the desired effect. The majority against him was as
strong as ever. A committee made up of his opponents was elected. A
motion to instruct them to make a rate was rejected, and a warrant
ordered to be forthwith issued for a special meeting of the
inhabitants, to examine into all the circumstances connected with the
settlement of Mr. Parris, and to ascertain whether the meetings which
had acted therein were legally called, and by what means the right and
title of the parish to its ministry house and lands had been brought
into question. This was pressing matters to an issue. Mr. Parris saw
it, and determined to meet it in advance. He resorted to his church,
as usual, to execute his plan, as the following entries on the
record-book show:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;1 Nov. 1691.&#8212;The pastor desired the brethren to meet at my
house, on to-morrow, an hour and half before sundown.</p>

<p>&quot;2 Nov. 1691.&#8212;After sunset, about seventeen of the brethren
met; to whom, after prayer, I spoke to this effect:
Brethren, I have not much to trouble you with now; but you
know what committee, the last town-meeting here, were
chosen; and what they have done, or intend to do; it may be
better than I. But, you see, I have hardly any wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[i.316]</a></span> to
burn. I need say no more, but leave the matter to your
serious and godly consideration.</p>

<p>&quot;In fine, after some discourse to and fro, the church voted
that Captain Putnam and the two deacons should go, as
messengers from the church, to the committee, to desire them
to make a rate for the minister, and to take care of
necessary supplies for him; and that said messengers should
make their return to the church the next tenth day, an hour
before sunset, at the minister's house, where they would
expect it.</p>

<p>&quot;10 Nov. 1691.&#8212;The messengers abovesaid came with their
return, as appointed; which was, that the committee did not
see good to take notice of their message, without they had
some letter to show under the church's and pastor's hand.
But, at this last church meeting, besides the three
messengers, but three other brethren did appear,&#8212;namely,
Brother Thomas Putnam, Thomas Wilkins, and Peter
Prescot,&#8212;which slight and neglect of other brethren did not
a little trouble me, as I expressed myself. But I told these
brethren I expected the church should be more mindful of me
than other people, and their way was plain before them, &amp;c.</p>

<p>&quot;Sab: 15 Nov. 1691.&#8212;The church were desired to meet at
Brother Nathaniel Putnam's, the next 18th instant, at twelve
o'clock, to spend some time in prayer, and seeking God's
presence with us, the next Lord's Day, at his table, as has
been usual with us, some time before the sacrament.</p>

<p>&quot;18 Nov. 1691.&#8212;After some time spent, as above said, at
this church meeting, the pastor desired the brethren to
stay, forasmuch as he had somewhat to offer to them, which
was to this purpose; viz.: Brethren, several church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[i.317]</a></span>
meetings have been occasionally warned, and sometimes the
appearance of the brethren is but small to what it might be
expected, and particularly the case mentioned 10th instant.
I told them I did not desire to warn meetings unnecessarily,
and, therefore, when I did, I prayed them they would
regularly attend them.</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, I told them I had scarce wood enough to burn
till the morrow, and prayed that some care might be taken.
In fine, after discourses passed, these following votes were
made unanimously, namely:&#8212;</p>

<p>&quot;1. That it was needful that complaint should be made to the
next honored County Court, to sit at Salem, the next third
day of the week, against the neglects of the present
committee.</p>

<p>&quot;2. That the said complaint should be drawn up, which was
immediately done by one of the brethren, and consented to.</p>

<p>&quot;3. That our brethren, Nathaniel Putnam, Thomas Putnam, and
Thomas Wilkins, should sign said complaint in behalf of the
church.</p>

<p>&quot;4. Last, That our brethren, Captain John Putnam and the two
deacons, should be improved to present the said complaint to
the said Court.</p>

<p>&quot;In the mean time, the pastor desired the brethren that care
might be taken that he might not be destitute of wood.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The record proceeds to give several other votes, the object of which
was to arrange the details of the manner in which the business was to
be put into court. There we leave it for the present, and there it
remained for nearly seven years. Mr. Parris probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[i.318]</a></span> got the start of
his opponents, in being first to invoke the law. This is what he meant
when he told his church &quot;that their way was plain before them.&quot; If
extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances had not intervened, the
case would more speedily have been disposed of, and we cannot doubt
what would have been its issue. Whatever might be the bias or
prejudice of the courts, or however they might have attempted to
enforce their first decisions, there can be no question, that, in such
a contest, the people would have finally prevailed. The committee were
men competent to carry the parish through. A religious society, with
such feelings between them and their minister, after all that had
happened, and the just grounds given them of dissatisfaction and
resentment, could not always, or long, have been kept under such an
infliction.</p>

<p>In the immediately preceding entries, there are some points that
illustrate the policy on which Mr. Parris acted, and exhibit the skill
and vigilance of his management. The motive that led him to harp so
constantly upon &quot;firewood&quot; is obvious. It was to create a sympathy in
his behalf, and bring opprobrium upon his opponents. But it cannot
stand the test of scrutiny: for it had been expressly agreed, as I
have said, that he should find his own fuel; and it cannot be supposed
that his friends, if he then had any real ones, surrounded, as they
were, with forests of their own, within sight of the parsonage, would
have allowed him to suffer from this cause. There is indication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[i.319]</a></span> that
the &quot;brethren of the church&quot; were getting lukewarm, as their
non-attendance at important meetings led Mr. Parris to fear. At any
rate, he felt it necessary to administer some rather significant
rebukes to them. The meeting for prayer, preparatory to the ensuing
communion service, was very adroitly converted into a business
consultation to inaugurate a lawsuit. But the most characteristic
thing, in this part of the church-book, is a marginal entry, against
the first paragraph of the record of the 2d November, 1691. It is in
these words:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;The town-meeting, about or at 16th October last. Jos:
Porter, Jos: Hutchinson, Jos: Putnam, Dan: Andrew, Francis
Nurse.&quot;</p></div>

<p>These were the committee appointed at the meeting. Their names, thus
abbreviated, are given, and not a syllable added. But the manner, the
then state of things, and their relation to the controversy, give a
deep import and intense bitterness to this entry. He knew the men, and
in their names read the handwriting on the wall.</p>

<p>But a turn was soon given to the current that was bearing Mr. Parris
down. A power was evoked&#8212;whether he raised it designedly, or whether
it merely happened to appear on the scene, we cannot certainly say;
but it came into action just at the nick of time&#8212;which instantly
reversed the position of the parties, and clothed him with a terrible
strength, enabling him to crush his opponents beneath his feet. In a
few short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[i.320]</a></span> months, he was the arbiter of life and death of all the
people of the village and the country. &quot;Jos: Porter and Jos:
Hutchinson&quot; escaped. The power of destruction broke down before it
became strong enough to reach them perhaps. &quot;Jos: Putnam&quot; was kept for
six months in the constant peril of his life. During all that time, he
and his family were armed, and kept watch. &quot;Dan: Andrew&quot; saved himself
from the gallows by flight to a foreign land. The unutterable woes
brought upon the family of &quot;Francis Nurse&quot; remain to be related.</p>

<p>The witchcraft delusion at Salem Village, in 1692, has attracted
universal attention, constitutes a permanent chapter in the world's
history, and demands a full exposition, and, if possible, a true
solution. Being convinced that it cannot be correctly interpreted
without a thorough knowledge of the people among whom it appeared, I
have felt it indispensable, before opening its scenes to view, or
treating the subject of demonology, of which it was an outgrowth, in
the first place to prepare myself, and those who accompany me in its
examination and discussion, to fully comprehend it, by traversing the
ground over which we have now passed. By a thorough history of Salem
Village from its origin to the period of our story, by calling its
founders and their children and successors into life before you by
personal, private, domestic, and local details, gleaned from old
records and documents, I have tried to place you at the standpoint
from which the entire occurrence can be intelligibly contemplated. We
can in no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[i.321]</a></span> way get a true view of a passage of history than by
looking at the men who acted in it, as they really were. We must
understand their characters, enter into their life, see with their
eyes, feel with their hearts, and be enveloped, as it were, with their
associations, sentiments, beliefs, and principles of action. In this
way only can we bring the past into our presence, comprehend its
elements, fathom its depths, read its meaning, or receive its lessons.</p>

<p>I am confident you will agree with me, that it was not because the
people of Salem Village were more ignorant, stupid, or weak-minded
than the people of other places, that the delusion made its appearance
or held its sway among them. This is a vital point to the just
consideration of the subject. I do not mean justice to them so much as
to ourselves and all who wish to understand, and be benefited by
understanding, the subject. There never was a community composed
originally of better materials, or better trained in all good usages.
Although the generations subsequent to the first had not enjoyed, to
any considerable extent, the advantages of education, the
circumstances of their experience had kept their faculties in the
fullest exercise. They were an energetic and intelligent people. Their
moral condition, social intercourse, manners, and personal bearing,
were excellent. The lesson of the catastrophe impending over them, at
the point to which we have arrived, can only be truly and fully
received, for the warning of all coming time, by having correct views
on this point. The delusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[i.322]</a></span> that brought ruin upon them was not the
result of any essential inferiority in their moral or intellectual
condition. What we call their ignorance was the received philosophy
and wisdom of the day, accepted generally by the great scholars of
that and previous ages, preached from the pulpits, taught in the
universities, recognized in law and in medicine as well as theology,
and carried out in the proceedings of public tribunals and legislative
assemblies.</p>

<p>The history of the planting, settlement, and progress of Salem
Village, to 1692, has now been given. We know, so far as existing
materials within reach enable us to know, what sort of a population
occupied the place at the date of our story. Their descent, breeding,
and experiences have been related. They were, at least, equal in
intelligence to any of the people of their day. They were strenuous in
action, trained to earnestness and zeal, accustomed to become deeply
engaged in whatever interested them, and to take strong hold of the
ideas and sentiments they received. It becomes necessary, therefore,
in the next place, to ascertain what their ideas were in reference to
witchcraft, diabolical agency, and supernaturalism generally. I shall
proceed accordingly to give the condition of opinion, at that time, on
the subject of demonology.</p>

<h2>PART SECOND.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<h3>WITCHCRAFT.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><b>EMONOLOGY</b>, as a general term, may be employed, for convenience, to
include a whole class of ideas&#8212;which, under different names and a
vast variety of conceptions, have come through all ages, and prevailed
among all races of mankind&#8212;relating to the supposed agency of
supernatural, invisible, and spiritual beings in terrestrial affairs.
As necessarily applicable to evil spirits, particularly to the
arch-enemy and supreme adversary of God and man under the name of
Satan or the Devil, the term does not appear to have been used in
ancient times. Professed communications with supernatural beings were
not originally stamped with a diabolical character, but, like some
alleged to be had in our day, were regarded as innocent, and even
creditable. Men sought to hold intercourse with spirits belonging to
the unseen world, as some persons do now; assuming that they were
worthy of confidence, and that responses from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[i.326]</a></span> them were valuable and
desirable. This was the case under the reign of classical mythology,
and of heathen superstition in general. Those individuals who were
supposed to be conversant with demons were looked upon by the
credulous multitude as a highly privileged class; and they arrogated
the credit of being raised to a higher sphere of knowledge than the
rest of mankind.</p>

<p>It is one of the most remarkable peculiarities of the Hebrew polity,
that it denounced such pretended communications as criminal, and
subjected the practice to the highest penalties. It was assumed to be
dangerous; the welfare of individuals and of society requiring that
such pretensions and practices should be abandoned. The observation
and experience of mankind have justified this view. In the first ages
of Christianity, it was believed that the Divine Being alone was to be
sought in prayer for light and guidance by the human soul. Gradually,
as the dark ages began to settle upon Christendom, the doctrine of the
Devil as the head and ruler of a world of demons, and as able to hold
communications with mortals, to interfere in their affairs, and to
exercise more or less control over the laws and phenomena of nature,
began to become prevalent. It was believed that human beings could
enter into alliance with the Prince of the power of the air; become
his confederates; join in a league with him and wicked spirits
subordinate to him, in undermining the Gospel and overthrowing the
Church; and conspire and co-operate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[i.327]</a></span> in rebellion against God. This,
of course, was regarded as the most flagrant of crimes, and
constituted the real character of the sin denominated &quot;witchcraft.&quot;</p>

<p>As the fullest, most memorable, and, by the notice it has ever since
attracted throughout the world, the pre-eminent instance and
demonstration of this supposed iniquity was in the crisis that took
place in Salem Village in 1692, it justly claims a place in history.
The community in which it occurred has been fully described, in its
moral, social, and intellectual condition, so far as the materials I
have been enabled to obtain have rendered possible. It has, I believe,
been made to appear, that, in their training, experience, and traits
of character, they were well adapted to give full effect to any
excitement, or earnest action of any kind, that could be got up among
them,&#8212;a people of great energy, courage, and resolution, well
prepared to carry out to its natural and legitimate results any
movement, and follow established convictions fearlessly to logical
conclusions. The experiment of bringing supernaturalism to operate in
human affairs, to become a ground of action in society, and to
interfere in the relations of life and the dealings of men with each
other, was as well tried upon this people as it ever could or can be
anywhere.</p>

<p>All that remains to be brought to view, before entering upon the
details of the narrative, is to give a just and adequate idea of the
form and shape in which the general subject of supernaturalism, in its
aspect as demonology, lay in the minds of men here at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[i.328]</a></span> time. To
do this, I must give a sketch, as condensed and brief as I can make
it, of the formation and progress of opinions and notions touching the
subject, until they reached their full demonstration and final
explosion, in this neighborhood, at Salem Village, near the close of
the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>No person who looks around him on the scene in which he is placed,
reflects upon the infinite wonders of creation, and meditates upon the
equal wonders of his own mind, can be at a loss respecting the sources
and causes of superstition. Let him transport himself back to the
condition of a primitive and unlettered people, before whom the world
appears in all its original and sublime mystery. Science has not
lifted to their eyes the curtain behind which the secret operations of
nature are carried on. They observe the tides rise and fall, but know
not the attractive law that regulates their movements; they
contemplate the procession of the seasons, without any conception of
the principles and causes that determine and produce their changes;
they witness the storm as it rises in its wrath; they listen with awe
to the thunder-peal, and gaze with startling terror upon the lightning
as it flashes from within the bosom of the black cloud, and are
utterly ignorant to what power to attribute the dreadful phenomena;
they look upward to the face of the sky, and see the myriad starry
hosts that glitter there, and all is to them a mighty maze of dazzling
confusion. It is for their fancy to explain, interpret, and fill up
the brilliant and magnificent scene.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[i.329]</a></span></p>

<p>The imagination was the faculty the exercise of which was chiefly
called for in such a state as this. Before science had traced the
operations and unfolded the secrets of nature, man was living in a
world full of marvel and mystery. His curiosity was attracted to every
object within the reach of his senses; and, in the absence of
knowledge, it was imagination alone that could make answer to its
inquiries. It is natural to suppose that he would be led to attribute
all the movements and operations of the external world which did not
appear to be occasioned by the exercise of his own power, or the power
of any other animal, to the agency of supernatural beings. We may also
conclude, that his belief would not be likely to fix upon the notion
of a single overruling Being. Although revelation and science have
disclosed to us a beautiful and entire unity and harmony in the
creation, the phenomena of the external world would probably impress
the unenlightened and unphilosophic observer with the belief that
there was a diversity in the powers which caused them. He would
imagine the agency of a being of an amiable and beneficent spirit in
the bright sunshine, the fresh breeze, and the mild moonlight; and his
fancy would suggest to his fears, that a dark, severe, and terrible
being was in the ascendant during a day overshadowed by frowning
clouds, or a night black with the storm and torn by the tempest.</p>

<p>By the aid of such reflections as these, we are easily conducted to a
satisfactory and sufficient explanation of the origin of the mythology
and fabulous super<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[i.330]</a></span>stitions of all ancient and primitive nations. From
this the progress is plain, obvious, and immediate to the pretensions
of magicians, diviners, sorcerers, conjurers, oracles, soothsayers,
augurs, and the whole catalogue of those persons who professed to hold
intercourse with higher and spiritual powers. There are several
classes into which they may be divided.</p>

<p>There were those who, to acquire an influence over the people,
pretended to possess the confidence, and enjoy the friendship and
counsel, of some one or more deities. Such was Numa, the early
lawgiver of the Roman State. In order to induce the people to adopt
the regulations, institutions, and religious rites he proposed, he
made them believe that he had access to a divinity, and received all
his plans and ideas as a communication from on high.</p>

<p>Persons who, in consequence of their superior acquirements, were
enabled to excel others in any pursuit, or who could foresee and avail
themselves of events in the natural world, were liable, without any
intention to deceive, to be classed under some of these denominations.
For instance, a Roman farmer, Furius Cresinus, surpassed all his
neighbors in the skill and success with which he managed his
agricultural affairs. He was accordingly accused of using magic arts
in the operations of his farm. So far were his neighbors carried by
their feelings of envy and jealousy, that they explained the fact of
his being able to derive more produce from a small lot of land than
they could from large ones, by charging him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[i.331]</a></span> with attracting and
drawing off the productions of their fields into his own by the
employment of certain mysterious charms. For his defence, as we are
informed by Pliny, he produced his strong and well-constructed
ploughs, his light and convenient spades, and his sun-burnt daughters,
and pointing to them exclaimed: &quot;Here are my charms; this is my magic;
these only are the witchcraft I have used.&quot; Zoroaster, the great
philosopher and astronomer of the ancient East, was charged with
divination and magic, merely, it is probable, because he possessed
uncommon acquirements.</p>

<p>There were persons who had acquired an extraordinary amount of natural
knowledge, and, for the sake of being regarded with wonder and awe by
the people, pretended to obtain their superior endowments from
supernatural beings. They affected the name and character of
sorcerers, diviners, and soothsayers. It is easy to conceive of the
early existence and the great influence of such impostors. Patient
observation, and often mere accident, would suggest discoveries of the
existence and operation of natural causes in producing phenomena
before ascribed to superhuman agency. The knowledge thus acquired
would be cautiously concealed, and cunningly used, to create
astonishment and win admiration. Its fortunate possessors were enabled
to secure the confidence, obedience, and even reverence, of the
benighted and deceived people.</p>

<p>Every one, indeed, who could discover a secret of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[i.332]</a></span> nature, and keep it
secret, was able to impose himself on the world as being allied with
supernatural powers. Hence arose the whole host of diviners,
astrologers, soothsayers, and oracles. After having once acquired
possession of the credulous faith of the people, they could impose
upon them almost without limit.</p>

<p>Those who pretended to hold this kind of intercourse with divinity
became, as a natural consequence, the priests of the nation,
constituted a distinct and regular profession, and perpetuated their
body by the admission of new members, to whom they explained their
arts, and communicated their knowledge. While they were continually
discovering and applying the secret principles and laws of nature, and
the people were kept in utter ignorance and darkness, it is no wonder
that they reached a great and unparalleled degree of power over the
mass of the population. In this manner we account for the origin, and
trace the history, of the Chaldean priests in Assyria, the Bramins of
India, the Magi of Persia, the Oracles of Greece, the Augurs of Italy,
the Druids of Britain, and the Pow-wows, Prophets, or &quot;Medicins,&quot; as
they sometimes called them, among our Indians.</p>

<p>It is probable that the witches mentioned in the Scriptures were of
this description. Neither in sacred nor profane ancient history do we
find what was understood in the days of our ancestors by witchcraft,
which meant a formal and actual compact with the great Prince of evil
beings. The sorcery of antiquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[i.333]</a></span> consisted in pretending to possess
certain mysterious charms, and to do by their means, or by the
co-operation of superhuman spirits, without any reference to their
character as evil or good beings, what transcends the action of mere
natural powers.</p>

<p>The witch of Endor, for instance, was a conjurer and necromancer,
rather than a witch. By referring to the 28th chapter of 1 Samuel,
where the interview between her and Saul is related, you will find no
ground for the opinion that the being from whom she pretended to
receive her mysterious power was Satan. Saul, as the ruler of a people
who were under the special government, and enjoyed the peculiar
protection of the true God, had forbidden, under the sanction of the
highest penalties, the exercise of the arts of divination and sorcery
within his jurisdiction. Some time after this, the unfortunate monarch
was overtaken by trouble and distress. His enemies had risen up, and
were gathered in fearful strength around him. His &quot;heart greatly
trembled,&quot; a dark and gloomy presentiment came over his spirit, and
his bosom was convulsed by an agony of solicitude. He turned toward
his God for light and strength. He applied for relief to the priests
of the altar, and to the prophets of the Most High; but his prayers
were unanswered, and his efforts vain. In his sorrow and apprehension,
he appealed to a woman who was reputed to have supernatural powers,
and to hold communion with spiritual beings; thus violating his own
law, and departing from duty and fidelity to his God. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[i.334]</a></span> begged her
to recall Samuel to life, that he might be comforted and instructed by
him. She pretended to comply with his request; but, before she could
commence her usual mysterious operations, Samuel arose! and the
forlorn, wretched, and heart-broken king listened to his tremendous
doom, as it was uttered by the spirit of the departed prophet.</p>

<p>I have alluded particularly to the witch of Endor, because she will
serve to illustrate the sorcery or divination of antiquity. She was
probably possessed of some secret knowledge of natural properties; was
skilful in the use of her arts and pretended charms; had, perhaps, the
peculiar powers of a ventriloquist; and, by successful imposture, had
acquired an uncommon degree of notoriety, and the entire confidence of
the public. She professed to be in alliance with supernatural beings,
and, by their assistance, to raise the dead.</p>

<p>This passage has afforded a topic for a great deal of discussion among
interpreters. It seems to me, on the face of the narrative, to suggest
the following view of the transaction: The woman was an impostor. When
she summoned the spirit of Samuel, instead of the results of her magic
lantern, or of whatever contrivances she may have had, by the
immediate agency of the Almighty the spirit of Samuel really rose, to
the consternation and horror of the pretended necromancer. The writer
appears to have indicated this as the proper interpretation of the
scene, by saying, &quot;that, when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a
loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[i.335]</a></span> voice;&quot; thus giving evidence of alarm and surprise totally
different from the deportment of such pretenders on such occasions:
they used rather to exhibit joy at the success of their arts, and a
proud composure and dignified complacency in the control they were
believed to exercise over the spirits that appeared to have obeyed
their call. Sir Walter Scott took this view of the transaction. His
opinion, it is true, would be considered more important in any other
department than that of biblical interpretation: on all questions,
however, connected with the spiritual world of fancy and with its
history, he must be allowed to speak, if not with the authority, at
least with the tone of a master. This wonderful author, in the
infinite profusion and variety of his productions, published a volume
upon Demonology and Witchcraft: it is, of course, entertaining and
instructive to all who are curious to know the capacity and to
appreciate the operations of the human imagination.</p>

<p>It will be regarded by intelligent and judicious persons as a
circumstance of importance in reference to the view now given of the
transaction in which the witch of Endor acts the leading part, that
Hugh Farmer, beyond all question the most learned, discreet, and
profound writer on such subjects, is inclined to throw the weight of
his authority in its favor. His ample and elaborate discussion of the
question is to be seen in his work on Miracles, chap. iv. sec. 2.</p>

<p>Among the heathen nations of antiquity, the art of divination
consisted, to a great degree, in the magical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[i.336]</a></span> use of mysterious
charms. Many plants were considered as possessed of wonderful virtues,
and there was scarcely a limit to the supposed power of those persons
who knew how to use and apply them skilfully. Virgil, in his eighth
eclogue, thus speaks of this species of sorcery:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;These herbs did Moeris give to me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And poisons pluckt at Pontus;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there they grow and multiplie<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She fetcht up souls out of their toome,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Removing corne from where it stood.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the fourth &#198;neid, the lovesick Tyrian queen is thus made to
describe the magic which was then believed to be practised:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Rejoice,&quot; she said: &quot;instructed from above,<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[i.337]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Tibullus, in the second elegy of his first book, gives the following
account of the powers ascribed to a magician:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;She plucks each star out of his throne,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And makes it snow at her desire<br /></span>
<span class="i2">E'en in the midst of summer season.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These views continued to hold undisturbed dominion over the people
during a long succession of centuries. As the twilight of the dark
ages began to settle upon Christendom, superstition, that
night-blooming plant, extended itself rapidly, and in all directions,
over the surface of the world. While every thing else drooped and
withered, it struck deeper its roots, spread wider its branches, and
brought forth more abundantly its fruit. The unnumbered fables of
Greek and Roman mythology, the arts of augury and divination, the
visions of oriental romance, the fanciful and attenuated theories of
the later philosophy, the abstract and spiritual doctrines of
Platonism, and all the grosser and wilder conceptions of the northern
conquerors of the Roman Empire, became mingled together in the faith
of the inhabitants of the European kingdoms. From this multifarious
combination, the infinitely diversified popular superstitions of the
modern nations have sprung.</p>

<p>We first begin to trace the clear outlines of the doc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[i.338]</a></span>trine of
witchcraft not far from the commencement of the Christian era. It
presupposes the belief of the Devil. I shall not enter upon the
question, whether the Scriptures, properly interpreted, require the
belief of the existence of such a being. Directing our attention
solely to profane sources of information, we discover the heathen
origin of the belief of the existence of the Devil in the ancient
systems of oriental philosophy. Early observers of nature in the East
were led to the conclusion, that the world was a divided empire, ruled
by the alternate or simultaneous energy of two great antagonist
principles or beings, one perfectly good, and the other perfectly bad.
It was for a long time, and perhaps is at this day, a prevalent faith
among Christians, that the Bible teaches a similar doctrine; that it
presents, to our adoration and obedience, a being of infinite
perfections in the Deity; and to our abhorrence and our fears, a being
infinitely wicked, and of great power, in the Devil.</p>

<p>It is obvious, that, when the entire enginery of supernaturalism was
organized in adaptation to the idea of the Devil, and demonology
became synonymous with diabolism, the credulity and superstition of
mankind would give a wide extension to that form of belief. It soon
occupied a large space in the theories of religion and the fancies of
the people, and got to be a leading element in the life of society. It
made its impress on the forms of speech, and many of the phrases to
which it gave rise still remain in familiar use. It figured in the
rituals of religion, in the paraphernalia of public shows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[i.339]</a></span> and in
fireside tales. It afforded leading characters to the drama in the
miracle plays and the moral plays, as they were called, at successive
periods. It offered a ready weapon to satire, and also to defamation.
Gerbert, a native of France, who was elevated to the pontificate about
the close of the tenth century, under the name of Sylvester II., is
eulogized by Mosheim as the first great restorer of science and
literature. He was a person of an extensive and sublime genius, of
wonderful attainments in learning, particularly mathematics, geometry,
and arithmetic. He broke the profound sleep of the dark ages, and
awakened the torpid intellect of the European nations. His efforts in
this direction roused the apprehensions and resentment of the monks;
and they circulated, after Gerbert's death, and made the ignorant
masses believe the story, that he had obtained his rapid promotion in
the Church by the practice of the black art, which he disguised under
the show of learning; that he secured the Archbishopric of Ravenna by
bribery and corruption; and that, finally, he made a bargain with
Satan, promising him his soul after death, on condition that he
(Satan) should put forth his great influence over the cardinals in
such a manner as would secure his election to the throne of St. Peter.
The arrangement was carried into successful operation. Sylvester, the
monks averred, consulted the Devil through the medium of a brazen head
during his whole reign, and enjoyed his faithful friendship and
unwavering patronage. But, when His Holiness came to die, he
endeavored to defraud Satan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[i.340]</a></span> of his rightful claim to his soul, by
repenting, and acknowledging his sin. This illustrates the way in
which the popular idea of the Devil was used to awaken ridicule and
gratify malignity.</p>

<p>The natural and ultimate effect of the diffusion of Christianity was
to overthrow, or rather to revolutionize, the whole system of
incantation and sorcery.</p>

<p>In heathen countries, as in the East at present and with those among
us who profess to hold communications with spirits, no reproach or
sentiment of disapprobation, as has already been observed, was
necessarily connected with the arts of divination; for the
supernatural beings with whom intercourse was alleged to be had were
not, with a few exceptions, regarded as evil beings. The persons who
were thought to be skilful in their use were, on the contrary, held in
great esteem, and looked upon with reverence. Magicians and
philosophers were convertible and synonymous terms. Learned and
scientific men were induced to encourage, and turn to their own
advantage, the popular credulity that ascribed their extraordinary
skill to their connection with spiritual and divine beings. At length,
however, they found themselves placed in a very uncomfortable
predicament by the prevalence of the new theology. It was exceedingly
difficult to dispel the delusion, and correct the error they had
previously found it for their interest to perpetuate in the minds of
the community. They could not convince them that their knowledge was
acquired from natural sources, or their operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[i.341]</a></span> conducted solely
by the aid of natural causes and laws. The people would not surrender
the belief, that the results of scientific experiments, and the
accuracy of predictions of physical phenomena, were secured by the
assistance of supernatural beings.</p>

<p>As the doctrines of the gospel gradually undermined the popular belief
in other spiritual beings inferior to the Deity, and were at the same
time supposed to teach the existence and extensively diffused energy
of an almost infinite and omnipotent agent of evil, it was exceedingly
natural, nay, it necessarily followed, that the credulity and
superstition which had led to the supposition of an alliance between
philosophers and spiritual beings should settle down into a full
conviction that the Devil was the being with whom they were thus
confederated. The consequence was that they were charged with
witchcraft, and many fell victims to the general prejudice and
abhorrence occasioned by the imputation. The influence of this state
of things was soon seen: it was one of the most effectual causes of
the rapid diffusion of knowledge in modern times. Philosophers and men
of science became as anxious to explain and publish their discoveries
as they had been in former ages to conceal and cover them with
mystery. The following instances will be sufficient to illustrate the
correctness of these views.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century, Roger Bacon was charged with witchcraft on
account of his discoveries in optics, chemistry, and astronomy; and,
although he did what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[i.342]</a></span> he could to circulate and explain his own
acquirements, he could not escape a papal denunciation, and two long
and painful imprisonments. In 1305, Arnold de Villa Nova, a learned
physician and philosopher, was burned at Padua, by order of
inquisitors, on the charge of witchcraft. He was eighty years of age.
Ten years afterwards, Peter Apon, also of Padua, who had made
extraordinary progress in knowledge, was accused of the same crime,
and condemned to death, but expired previous to the time appointed for
his execution.</p>

<p>I will now present a brief sketch of the most noticeable facts
relating to the subject in Europe and Great Britain previous to the
close of the seventeenth century. Some writers have computed that
thirty thousand persons were executed for this supposed crime, within
one hundred and fifty years. It will of course be in my power to
mention only a few instances.</p>

<p>In 1484, Pope Innocent the Eighth issued a bull encouraging and
requiring the arrest and punishment of persons suspected of
witchcraft. From this moment, the prosecutions became frequent and the
victims numerous in every country. The very next year, forty-one aged
females were consigned to the flames in one nation; and, not long
after, a hundred were burned by one inquisition in the devoted valleys
of Piedmont; forty-eight were burned in Ravensburg in five years; and,
in the year 1515, five hundred were burned at Geneva in three months!
One writer de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[i.343]</a></span>clares that &quot;almost an infinite number&quot; were burned for
witchcraft in France,&#8212;a thousand in a single diocese! These
sanguinary and horrible transactions were promoted and sanctioned by
theological hatred and rancor. It was soon perceived that there was no
kind of difficulty in clearing the Church of heretics by hanging or
burning them all as witches! The imputation of witchcraft could be
fixed upon any one with the greatest facility. In the earlier part of
the fifteenth century, the Earl of Bedford, having taken the
celebrated Joan of Arc prisoner, put her to death on this charge. She
had been almost adored by the people rescued by her romantic valor,
and was universally known among them by the venerable title of &quot;Holy
Maid of God;&quot; but no difficulty was experienced in procuring evidence
enough to lead her to the stake as a servant and confederate of Satan!
Luther was just beginning his attack upon the papal power, and he was
instantly accused of being in confederacy with the Devil.</p>

<p>In 1534, Elizabeth Barton, &quot;the Maid of Kent,&quot; was executed for
witchcraft in England, together with seven men who had been
confederate with her. In 1541 the Earl of Hungerford was beheaded for
inquiring of a witch how long Henry VIII. would live. In 1549 it was
made the duty of bishops, by Archbishop Cranmer's articles of
visitation, to inquire of their clergy, whether &quot;they know of any that
use charms, sorcery, enchantments, witchcraft, soothsaying, or any
like craft invented by the Devil.&quot; In 1563<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[i.344]</a></span> the King of Sweden carried
four witches with him, as a part of his armament, to aid him in his
wars with the Danes. In 1576, seventeen or eighteen were condemned in
Essex, in England. A single judge or inquisitor, Remigius, condemned
and burned nine hundred within fifteen years, from 1580 to 1595, in
the single district of Lorraine; and as many more fled out of the
country; whole villages were depopulated, and fifteen persons
destroyed themselves rather than submit to the torture which, under
the administration of this successor of Draco and rival of Jeffries,
was the first step taken in the trial of an accused person. The
application of the rack and other instruments of torment, in the
examination of prisoners, was recommended by him in a work on
witchcraft. He observes that &quot;scarcely any one was known to be brought
to repentance and confession but by these means&quot;!</p>

<p>The most eminent persons of the sixteenth century were believers in
the popular superstition respecting the existence of compacts between
Satan and human beings, and in the notions associated with it. The
excellent Melancthon was an interpreter of dreams and caster of
nativities. Luther was a strenuous supporter of the doctrine of
witchcraft, and seems to have seriously believed that he had had
frequent interviews with the arch-enemy himself, and had disputed with
him on points of theology, face to face. In his &quot;Table-Talk,&quot; he gives
the following account of his intimacy with the Devil: speaking of his
confinement in the Castle of Wartburg, he says, &quot;Among other things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[i.345]</a></span>
they brought me hazel-nuts, which I put into a box, and sometimes I
used to crack and eat of them. In the night-times, my gentleman, the
Devil, came and got the nuts out of the box, and cracked them against
one of the bedposts, making a very great noise and rumbling about my
bed; but I regarded him nothing at all: when afterwards I began to
slumber, then he kept such a racket and rumbling upon the chamber
stairs, as if many empty barrels and hogsheads had been tumbled down.&quot;
Kepler, whose name is immortalized by being associated with the laws
he discovered that regulate the orbits of the heavenly bodies, was a
zealous advocate of astrology; and his great predecessor and master,
the Prince of Astronomers, as he is called, Tycho Brahe, kept an idiot
in his presence, fed him from his own table, with his own hand, and
listened to his incoherent, unmeaning, and fatuous expressions as to a
revelation from the spiritual world.</p>

<p>The following is the language addressed to Queen Elizabeth by Bishop
Jewell. He was one of the most learned persons of his age, and is to
this day regarded as the mighty champion of the Church of England, and
of the cause of the Reformation in Great Britain. He was the terrible
foe of Roman-Catholic superstition. &quot;It may please Your Grace,&quot; says
he, &quot;to understand that witches and sorcerers within these four last
years are marvellously increased within Your Grace's realm; Your
Grace's subjects pine away even unto the death; their color fadeth,
their flesh rotteth, their speech is benumbed, their senses are
bereft. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[i.346]</a></span> pray God,&quot; continues the courtly preacher, &quot;they never
practise further than upon the subject.&quot; The petition of the polite
prelate appears to have been answered. The virgin queen resisted
inexorably the arts of all charmers, and is thought never to have been
bewitched in her life.</p>

<p>It is probable that Spenser, in his &quot;Fa&#235;rie Queen,&quot; has described with
accuracy the witch of the sixteenth century in the following beautiful
lines:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&quot;There, in a gloomy hollow glen, she found<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A little cottage built of sticks and weedes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In homely wise, and wald with sods around,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In which a witch did dwell in loathly weedes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And wilful want, all careless of her needes;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So choosing solitarie to abide<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far from all neighbors, that her devilish deedes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hellish arts from people she might hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hurt far off unknowne whomever she envide.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So prone were some to indulge in the contemplation of the agency of
the Devil and his myrmidons, that they strained, violated, and
perverted the language of Scripture to make it speak of them. Thus
they insisted that the word &quot;Philistines&quot; meant confederates and
subjects of the Devil, and accordingly interpreted the expression, &quot;I
will deliver you into the hands of the Philistines,&quot; thus, &quot;I will
deliver you into the hands of demons.&quot;</p>

<p>I cannot describe the extent to which the superstition we are
reviewing was carried about the close of the sixteenth century in
stronger language than the following, from a candid and learned French
Roman-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[i.347]</a></span>Catholic historian: &quot;So great folly,&quot; says he, &quot;did then
oppress the miserable world, that Christians believed greater
absurdities than could ever be imposed upon the heathens.&quot;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We have now arrived at the commencement of the seventeenth century,
within which the prosecutions for witchcraft took place in Salem. To
show the opinions of the clergy of the English Church at this time, I
will quote the following curious canon, made by the convocation in
1603:&#8212;</p>

<p>&quot;That no minister or ministers, without license and direction of the
bishop, under his hand and seal obtained, attempt, upon any pretence
whatsoever, either of possession or obsession, by fasting and prayer,
to cast out any devil or devils, under pain of the imputation of
imposture or cozenage, and deposition from the ministry.&quot; In the same
year, licenses were actually granted, as required above, by the Bishop
of Chester; and several ministers were duly authorized by him to cast
out devils!</p>

<p>During this whole century, there were trials and executions for
witchcraft in all civilized countries. More than two hundred were
hanged in England, thousands were burned in Scotland, and still larger
numbers in various parts of Europe.</p>

<p>Edward Fairfax, the poet, was one of the most accomplished men in
England. He is celebrated as the translator of Tasso's &quot;Jerusalem
Delivered,&quot; in allusion to which work Collins thus speaks of him:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[i.348]</a></span>&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;How have I sate, while piped the pensive wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To hear thy harp, by British Fairfax strung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prevailing poet, whose undoubting mind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Believed the magic wonders that he sung.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This same Fairfax prosecuted six of his neighbors for bewitching his
children. The trials took place about the time the first pilgrims came
to America.</p>

<p>In 1634, Urbain Grandier, a very learned and eminent French minister,
rendered himself odious to the bigoted nuns of Loudun, by his
moderation towards heretics. Secretly instigated, as has been
supposed, by Cardinal Richelieu, against whom he had written a satire,
they pretended to be bewitched by him, and procured his prosecution:
he was tortured upon the rack until he swooned, and then was burned at
the stake. In 1640, Dr. Lamb, of London, was murdered in the streets
of that city by the mob, on suspicion of witchcraft. Several were
hanged in England, only a few years before the proceedings commenced
in Salem. Some were tried by water ordeal, and drowned in the process,
in Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, and Northamptonshire, at the very
time the executions were going on here; and a considerable number of
capital punishments took place in various parts of Great Britain, some
years after the prosecution had ceased in America.</p>

<p>The trials and executions in England and Scotland were attended by
circumstances as painful, as barbarous, and in all respects as
disgraceful, as those occurring in Salem. Every species of torture
seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[i.349]</a></span> have been resorted to: the principles of reason, justice,
and humanity were set at defiance, and the whole body of the people
kept in a state of the most fierce excitement against the sufferers.
Indeed, there is nothing more distressing in the contemplation of
these sanguinary proceedings than the spirit of deliberate and
unmitigated cruelty with which they were conducted. No symptoms of
pity, compassion, or sympathy, appear to have been manifested by the
judges or the community. The following account of the expenses
attending the execution of two persons convicted of witchcraft in
Scotland, shows in what a cool, business-like style the affair was
managed:&#8212;</p>

<p>The brutalizing effects of capital punishments are clearly seen in
these, as in all other instances. They gradually impart a feeling of
indifference to the value of human life, or to the idea of cutting it
off by the hand of violence, to all who become accustomed to the
spectacle. In various ways they exercise influences upon the tone and
temper of society, which can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[i.350]</a></span>not but be regarded with regret by the
citizen, the legislator, the moralist, the philanthropist, and the
Christian.</p>

<p>Sinclair, in his work called &quot;Satan's Invisible World Discovered,&quot;
gives the following affecting declaration made by one of the
confessing witches, as she was on her way to the stake:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Now all you that see me this day know that I am now to die
as a witch by my own confession; and I free all men,
especially the ministers and magistrates, of the guilt of my
blood; I take it wholly upon myself, my blood be upon my own
head: and, as I must make answer to the God of heaven
presently, I declare I am as free of witchcraft as any
child; but, being delated by a malicious woman, and put in
prison under the name of a witch, disowned by my husband and
friends, and seeing no ground of hope of my coming out of
prison, or ever coming in credit again, through the
temptation of the Devil, I made up that confession on
purpose to destroy my own life, being weary of it, and
choosing rather to die than live.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Sir George Mackenzie says that he went to examine some women who had
confessed, and that one of them, who was a silly creature, told him,
&quot;under secresie,&quot; &quot;that she had not confessed because she was guilty,
but, being a poor creature, who wrought for her meat, and being
defamed for a witch, she knew she would starve, for no person
thereafter would either give her meat or lodging, and that all men
would beat her, and hound dogs at her, and that therefore she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[i.351]</a></span> desired
to be out of the world.&quot; Whereupon she wept most bitterly, and, upon
her knees, called God to witness to what she said.</p>

<p>A wretch, named Matthew Hopkins, rendered himself infamously
conspicuous in the prosecutions for witchcraft that took place in the
counties of Essex, Sussex, Norfolk, and Huntingdon, in England, in the
years 1645 and 1646. The title he assumed indicates the part he acted:
it was &quot;Witch-finder-general.&quot; He travelled from place to place; his
expenses were paid; and he required, in addition, regular fees for the
discovery of a witch. Besides pricking the body to find the
witch-mark, he compelled the wretched and decrepit victims of his
cruel practices to sit in a painful posture, on an elevated stool,
with their limbs crossed; and, if they persevered in refusing to
confess, he would prolong their torture, in some cases, to more than
twenty-four hours. He would prevent their going to sleep, and drag
them about barefoot over the rough ground, thus overcoming them with
extreme weariness and pain: but his favorite method was to tie the
thumb of the right hand close to the great toe of the left foot, and
draw them through a river or pond; if they floated, as they would be
likely to do, while their heavier limbs were thus sustained and
upborne by the rope, it was considered as conclusive proof of their
guilt. This monster was encouraged and sanctioned by the government;
and he procured the death, in one year and in one county, of more than
three times as many as suffered in Salem during the whole delusion.
He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[i.352]</a></span> and his exploits are referred to in the following lines, from that
storehouse of good sense and keen wit, Butler's &quot;Hudibras:&quot;&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Hath not this present Parliament<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A leiger to the Devil sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fully empowered to treat about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finding revolted witches out?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And has he not within a year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hanged threescore of them in one shire?&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The infatuated people looked upon this Hopkins with admiration and
astonishment, and could only account for his success by the
supposition, which, we are told, was generally entertained, that he
had stolen the memorandum-book in which Satan had recorded the names
of all the persons in England who were in league with him!</p>

<p>The most melancholy circumstance connected with the history of this
creature is, that Richard Baxter and Edmund Calamy&#8212;names dear and
venerable in the estimation of all virtuous and pious men&#8212;were
deceived and deluded by him: they countenanced his conduct, followed
him in his movements, and aided him in his proceedings.</p>

<p>At length, however, some gentlemen, shocked at the cruelty and
suspicious of the integrity of Hopkins, seized him, tied his thumbs
and toes together, threw him into a pond, and dragged him about to
their hearts' content. They were fully satisfied with the result of
the experiment. It was found that he did not sink. He stood condemned
on his own principles; and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[i.353]</a></span> the country was rescued from the
power of the malicious impostor.</p>

<p>Among the persons whose death Hopkins procured, was a venerable,
gray-headed clergyman, named Lewis. He was of the Church of England,
had been the minister of a congregation for more than half a century,
and was over eighty years of age. His infirm frame was subjected to
the customary tests, even to the trial by water ordeal: he was
compelled to walk almost incessantly for several days and nights,
until, in the exhaustion of his nature, he yielded assent to a
confession that was adduced against him in Court; which, however, he
disowned and denied there and at all times, from the moment of release
from the torments, by which it had been extorted, to his last breath.
As he was about to die the death of a felon, he knew that the rites of
sepulture, according to the forms of his denomination, would be denied
to his remains. The aged sufferer, it is related, read his own funeral
service while on the scaffold. Solemn, sublime, and affecting as are
passages of this portion of the ritual of the Church, surely it was
never performed under circumstances so well suited to impress with awe
and tenderness as when uttered by the calumniated, oppressed, and
dying old man. Baxter had been tried for sedition, on the ground that
one of his publications contained a reflection upon Episcopacy, and
was imprisoned for two years. It is a striking and melancholy
illustration of the moral infirmity of human nature, that the author
of the &quot;Saints' Everlast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[i.354]</a></span>ing Rest,&quot; and the &quot;Call to the Unconverted,&quot;
permitted such a vengeful feeling against the Establishment to enter
his breast, that he took pleasure, and almost exulted, in relating the
fate of this innocent and aged clergyman, whom he denominates, in
derision, a &quot;Reading Parson.&quot;</p>

<p>Baxter's writings are pervaded by his belief in all sorts of
supernatural things. In the &quot;Saints' Everlasting Rest,&quot; he declares
his conviction of the reality and authenticity of stories of ghosts,
apparitions, haunted houses, &amp;c. He placed full faith in a tale,
current among the people of his day, of the &quot;dispossession of the
Devil out of many persons together in a room in Lancashire, at the
prayer of some godly ministers.&quot; In his &quot;Dying Thoughts,&quot; he says, &quot;I
have had many convincing proofs of witches, the contracts they have
made with devils, and the power which they have received from them;&quot;
and he seems to have credited the most absurd fables ever invented on
the subject by ignorance, folly, or fraud.</p>

<p>The case to which he refers, as one of the &quot;dispossession of devils,&quot;
may be found in a tract published in London in 1697, entitled, &quot;The
Surey Demoniac; or, an Account of Satan's strange and dreadful
actings, in and about the body of Richard Dugdale, of Surey, near
Whalley, in Lancashire. And how he was dispossessed by God's blessing
on the Fastings and Prayers of divers Ministers and People. The matter
of fact attested by the oaths of several creditable persons, before
some of his Majestie's Justices of the Peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[i.355]</a></span> in the said county.&quot; The
&quot;London Monthly Repository&quot; (vol. v., 1810) describes the affair as
follows: &quot;These dreadful actings of Satan continued above a year;
during which there was a desperate struggle between him and nine
ministers of the gospel, who had undertaken to cast him out, and, for
that purpose, successively relieved each other in their daily combats
with him: while Satan tried all his arts to baffle their attempts,
insulting them with scoffs and raillery, puzzling them sometimes with
Greek and Latin, and threatening them with the effects of his
vengeance, till he was finally vanquished and put to flight by the
persevering prayers and fastings of the said ministers.&quot;</p>

<p>No name in English history is regarded with more respect and
admiration, by wise and virtuous men, than that of Sir Matthew Hale.
His character was almost venerated by our ancestors; and it has been
thought that it was the influence of his authority, more than any
thing else, that prevailed upon them to pursue the course they adopted
in the prosecutions at Salem. This great and good man presided, as
Lord Chief Baron, at the trial of two females,&#8212;Amy Dunny and Rose
Cullender,&#8212;at Bury St. Edmunds, in Suffolk, in the year 1664. They
were convicted and executed.</p>

<p>Baxter relates the following circumstance as having occurred at this
trial: &quot;A godly minister, yet living, sitting by to see one of the
girls (who appeared as a witness against the prisoners) in her fits,
suddenly felt a force pull one of the hooks from his breeches; and,
while he looked with wonder at what was become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[i.356]</a></span> of it, the tormented
girl vomited it up out of her mouth.&quot;</p>

<p>To give an idea of the nature of the testimony upon which the
principal stress was laid by the government, I will extract the
following passages from the report of the trial: &quot;Robert Sherringham
testified that the axle-tree of his cart, happening, in passing, to
break some part of Rose Cullender's house, in her anger at it, she
vehemently threatened him his horses should suffer for it; and, within
a short time, all his four horses died; after which he sustained many
other losses, in the sudden dying of his cattle. He was also taken
with a lameness in his limbs, and so far vexed with lice of an
extraordinary number and bigness, that no art could hinder the
swarming of them, till he burned up two suits of apparel.&quot;&#8212;&quot;Margaret
Arnold testified that Amy Dunny afflicted her children: they (the
children), she said, would see mice running round the house, and, when
they caught them and threw them into the fire, they would screech out
like rats.&quot;&#8212;&quot;A thing like a bee flew at the face of the younger
child; the child fell into a fit, and at last vomited up a two-penny
nail, with a broad head, affirming that the bee brought this nail, and
forced it into her mouth.&quot;&#8212;&quot;She one day caught an invisible mouse,
and, throwing it into the fire, it flashed like to gunpowder. None
besides the child saw the mouse, but every one saw the flash!&quot;</p>

<p>In this instance we perceive the influence of prejudice in perverting
evidence. The circumstance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[i.357]</a></span> the mouse was invisible to all eyes
but those of the child ought to have satisfied the Court and jury that
she was either under the power of a delusion or practising an
imposture. But, as they were predisposed to find something
supernatural in the transaction, their minds seized upon the pretended
invisibility of the mouse as conclusive proof of diabolical agency.</p>

<p>Many persons who were present expressed the opinion, that the issue of
the trial would have been favorable to the prisoners, had it not been
for the following circumstance: Sir Thomas Browne, a physician,
philosopher, and scholar of unrivalled celebrity at that time,
happened to be upon the spot; and it was the universal wish that he
should be called to the stand, and his opinion be obtained on the
general subject of witchcraft. An enthusiastic contemporary admirer of
Sir Thomas Browne thus describes him: &quot;The horizon of his
understanding was much larger than the hemisphere of the world: all
that was visible in the heavens he comprehended so well, that few that
are under them knew so much; and of the earth he had such a minute and
exact geographical knowledge as if he had been by Divine Providence
ordained surveyor-general of the whole terrestrial globe and its
products, minerals, plants, and animals.&quot; His memory is stated to have
been inferior only to that of Seneca or Scaliger; and he was reputed
master of seven languages. Dr. Johnson, who has written his biography,
sums up his character in the following terms: &quot;But it is not on the
praises of others, but on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[i.358]</a></span> own writings, that he is to depend for
the esteem of posterity, of which he will not easily be deprived,
while learning shall have any reverence among men: for there is no
science in which he does not discover some skill; and scarce any kind
of knowledge, profane or sacred, abstruse or elegant, which he does
not appear to have cultivated with success.&quot;</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Browne was considered by those of his own generation to
have made great advances beyond the wisdom of his age. He claimed the
character of a reformer, and gave to his principal publication the
title of an &quot;Enquiry into Vulgar Errors.&quot; So bold and free were his
speculations, that he was looked upon invidiously by many as a daring
innovator, and did not escape the denunciatory imputation of heresy.
Nothing could be more unjust, however, than this latter charge. He was
a most ardent and zealous believer in the doctrines of the Established
Church. He declares &quot;that he assumes the honorable style of a
Christian,&quot; not because &quot;it is the religion of his country,&quot; but
because, &quot;having in his riper years and confirmed judgment seen and
examined all, he finds himself obliged, by the principles of grace and
the law of his own reason, to embrace no other name but this.&quot; He
exults and &quot;blesses himself, that he lived not in the days of
miracles, when faith had been thrust upon him, but enjoys that greater
blessing pronounced to all that believed, and saw not:&quot; nay, he goes
so far as to say, that they only had the advantage &quot;of a bold and
noble faith, who lived before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[i.359]</a></span> coming of the Saviour, and, upon
obscure prophecies and mystical types, could raise a belief.&quot; The fact
that such a man was accused of infidelity is an affecting proof of the
injustice that is sometimes done by the judgment of contemporaries.</p>

<p>This prodigy of learning and philosophy went into Court, took the
stand, and declared his opinion in favor of the reality of witchcraft,
entered into a particular discussion of the subject before the jury,
threw the whole weight of his great name into the wavering scales of
justice, and the poor women were convicted. The authority of Sir
Thomas Browne, added to the other evidence, perplexed Sir Matthew
Hale. A reporter of the trial says, &quot;that it made this great and good
man doubtful; but he was in such fears, and proceeded with such
caution, that he would not so much as sum up the evidence, but left it
to the jury with prayers, 'that the great God of heaven would direct
their hearts in that weighty matter.'&quot;</p>

<p>The result of this important trial established decisively the
interpretation of English law; and the printed report of it was used
as an authoritative text-book in the Court at Salem.</p>

<p>The celebrated Robert Boyle flourished in the latter half of the
seventeenth century. He is allowed by all to have done much towards
the introduction of an improved philosophy, and the promotion of
experimental science. But he could not entirely shake off the
superstition of his age.</p>

<p>A small city in Burgundy, called Mascon, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[i.360]</a></span> famous in the annals of
witchcraft. In a work called &quot;The Theatre of God's Judgments,&quot;
published, in London, by Thomas Beard in 1612, there is the following
passage: &quot;It was a very lamentable spectacle that chanced to the
Governor of Mascon, a magician, whom the Devil snatched up in
dinner-while, and hoisted aloft, carrying him three times about the
town of Mascon, in the presence of many beholders, to whom he cried in
this manner, 'Help, help, my friends!' so that the whole town stood
amazed thereat; yea, and the remembrance of this strange accident
sticketh at this day fast in the minds of all the inhabitants of this
country.&quot; A malicious and bigoted monk, who discharged the office of
chief legend-maker to the Benedictine Abbey, in the vicinity of
Mascon, fabricated this ridiculous story for the purpose of bringing
the Governor into disrepute. An account of another diabolical
visitation, suggested, it is probable, by the one just described, was
issued from the press, under the title of &quot;The Devil of Mascon,&quot;
during the lifetime of Boyle, who gave his sanction to the work,
promoted its version into English, and, as late as 1678, publicly
declared his belief of the supernatural transaction it related.</p>

<p>The subject of demonology, in all its forms and phases, embracing
witchcraft, held a more commanding place throughout Europe, in the
literature of the centuries immediately preceding the eighteenth, than
any other. Works of the highest pretension, elaborate, learned,
voluminous, and exhausting, were published,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[i.361]</a></span> by the authority of
governments and universities, to expound it. It was regarded as
occupying the most eminent department of jurisprudence, as well as of
science and theology.</p>

<p>Raphael De La Torre and Adam Tanner published treatises establishing
the right and duty of ecclesiastical tribunals to punish all who
practised or dealt with the arts of demonology. In 1484, Sprenger came
out with his famous book, &quot;Malleus Maleficarum;&quot; or, the &quot;Hammer of
Witches.&quot; Paul Layman, in 1629, issued an elaborate work on &quot;Judicial
Processes against Sorcerers and Witches.&quot; The following is the title
of a bulky volume of some seven hundred pages: &quot;Demonology, or Natural
Magic or demoniacal, lawful and unlawful, also open or secret, by the
intervention and invocation of a Demon,&quot; published in 1612. It
consists of four books, treating of the crime of witchcraft, and its
punishment in the ordinary tribunals and the Inquisitorial office. Its
author was Don Francisco Torreblanca Villalpando, of Cordova, Advocate
Royal in the courts of Grenada. It was republished in 1623, by command
of Philip III. of Spain, on the recommendation of the Fiscal General,
and with the sanction of the Royal Council and the Holy Inquisition.
This work may be considered as establishing and defining the
doctrines, in reference to witchcraft, prevailing in all Catholic
countries. It was indorsed by royal, judicial, academical, and
ecclesiastical approval; is replete with extraordinary erudition,
arranged in the most scientific form, em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[i.362]</a></span>bracing in a methodical
classification all the minutest details of the subject, and codifying
it into a complete system of law. There was no particular in all the
proceedings and all the doctrines brought out at the trials in Salem,
which did not find ample justification and support in this work of
Catholic, imperial, and European authority.</p>

<p>But perhaps the writer of the greatest influence on this subject in
England and America, during the whole of the seventeenth century, was
William Perkins, &quot;the learned, pious, and painful preacher of God's
Word, at St. Andrew's, in Cambridge,&quot; where he died, in 1602, aged
forty-four years. He was quite a voluminous author; and many of his
works were translated into French, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish.
Fuller, in &quot;The Holy State,&quot; selects him as the impersonation of the
qualities requisite to &quot;the Faithful Minister.&quot; In his glowing
eulogium upon his learning and talents, he says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;He would pronounce the word <i>damne</i> with such an emphasis
as left a doleful echo in his auditors' ears a good while
after. And, when catechist of Christ's College, in
expounding the Commandments, applied them so home,&#8212;able
almost to make his hearers' hearts fall down, and hairs to
stand upright. But, in his older age, he altered his voice,
and remitted much of his former rigidness, often professing
that to preach mercy was that proper office of the ministers
of the gospel.&quot;&#8212;&quot;Our Perkins brought the schools into the
pulpit, and, unshelling their controversies out of their
hard school-terms, made thereof plain and wholesome meat for
his peo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[i.363]</a></span>ple; for he had a capacious head, with angles
winding, and roomy enough to lodge all controversial
intricacies.&quot;&#8212;&quot;He had a rare felicity in speedy reading of
books; so that, as it were, riding post through an author,
he took strict notice of all passages. Perusing books so
speedily, one would think he read nothing; so accurately,
one would think he read all.&quot;</p></div>

<p>An octavo volume, written by this great scholar and divine, was
published at Cambridge in England, under the title, &quot;Discourse of the
Damned Art of Witchcraft.&quot; It went through several editions, and had a
wide and permanent circulation.</p>

<p>This work, the character of which is sufficiently indicated in its
emphatic title, was the great authority on the subject with our
fathers; and Mr. Parris had a copy of it in his possession when the
proceedings in reference to witchcraft began at Salem Village.</p>

<p>John Gaule published an octavo volume in London, in 1646, entitled,
&quot;Select Cases of Conscience concerning Witches and Witchcraft.&quot; He is
one of the most exact writers on the subject, and arranges witches in
the following classes: &quot;1. The diviner, gypsy, or fortune-telling
witch; 2. The astrologian, star-gazing, planetary, prognosticating
witch; 3. The chanting, canting, or calculating witch, who works by
signs and numbers; 4. The venefical, or poisoning witch; 5. The
exorcist, or conjuring witch; 6. The gastronomic witch; 7. The
magical, speculative, sciential, or arted witch; 8. The necromancer.&quot;</p>

<p>Besides innumerable writers of this class, who spread out the
scholastic learning on the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[i.364]</a></span> and presented it in a logical and
theological form, there were others who treated it in a more popular
style, and invested it with the charms of elegant literature. Henry
Hallywell published an octavo in London, in 1681, in which, while the
main doctrines of witchcraft as then almost universally received are
enforced, an attempt was made to divest it of some of its most
repulsive and terrible features. He gives the following account of the
means by which a person may place himself beyond the reach of the
power of witchcraft:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;It is possible for the soul to arise to such a height, and
become so divine, that no witchcraft or evil demons can have
any power upon the body. When the bodily life is too far
invigorated and awakened, and draws the intellect, the
flower and summity of the soul, into a conspiration with it,
then are we subject and obnoxious to magical assaults. For
magic or sorcery, being founded only in this lower or
mundane spirit, he that makes it his business to be freed
and released from all its blandishments and flattering
devocations, and endeavors wholly to withdraw himself from
the love of corporeity and too near a sympathy with the
frail flesh, he, by it, enkindles such a divine principle as
lifts him above the fate of this inferior world, and adorns
his mind with such an awful majesty that beats back all
enchantments, and makes the infernal fiends tremble at his
presence, hating those vigorous beams of light which are so
contrary and repugnant to their dark natures.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The mind of this beautiful writer found encouragement and security in
the midst of the diabolical spir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[i.365]</a></span>its, with whom he believed the world
to be infested, in the following views and speculations:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;For there is a chain of government that runs down from God,
the Supreme Monarch, whose bright and piercing eyes look
through all that he has made, to the lowest degree of the
creation; and there are presidential angels of empires and
kingdoms, and such as under them have the tutelage of
private families; and, lastly, every man's particular
guardian genius. Nor is the inanimate or material world left
to blind chance or fortune; but there are, likewise, mighty
and potent spirits, to whom is committed the guidance and
care of the fluctuating and uncertain motions of it, and by
their ministry, fire and vapor, storms and tempests, snow
and hail, heat and cold, are all kept within such bounds and
limits as are most serviceable to the ends of Providence.
They take care of the variety of seasons, and superintend
the tillage and fruits of the earth; upon which account,
Origen calls them <i>invisible</i> husbandmen. So that, all
affairs and things being under the inspection and government
of these incorporeal beings, the power of the dark kingdom
and its agents is under a strict confinement and restraint;
and they cannot bring a general mischief upon the world
without a special permission of a superior Providence.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Spenser has the same imagery and sentiment:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;How oft do they their silver bowers leave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To come to succor us, that succor want?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How oft do they with golden pinions cleave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flitting skies, like flying pursuivant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against foul fiends to aid us militant?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They for us fight, they watch and duly ward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their bright squadrons round about us plant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all for love and nothing for reward:<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[i.366]</a></span></div></div>

<p>While there can be no doubt that the superstitious opinions we have
been reviewing were diffused generally among the great body of the
people of all ranks and conditions, it would be unjust to truth not to
mention that there were some persons who looked upon them as empty
fables and vain imaginations. Error has never yet made a complete and
universal conquest. In the darkest ages and most benighted regions, it
has been found impossible utterly to extinguish the light of reason.
There always have been some in whose souls the torch of truth has been
kept burning with vestal watchfulness: we can discern its glimmer here
and there through the deepest night that has yet settled upon the
earth. In the midst of the most extravagant superstition, there have
been individuals who have disowned the popular belief, and considered
it a mark of wisdom and true philosophy to discard the idle fancies
and absurd schemes of faith that possessed the minds of the great mass
of their contemporaries. This was the case with Horace, as appears
from lines thus quite freely but effectively translated:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;These dreams and terrors magical,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These miracles and witches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night-walking spirites or Thessal bugs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Esteeme them not two rushes.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The intellect of Seneca also rose above the reach of the popular
credulity with respect to the agency of supernatural beings and the
efficacy of mysterious charms.</p>

<p>If we could but obtain access to the secret thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[i.367]</a></span> of the wisest
philosophers and of the men of genius of antiquity, we should probably
find that many of them were superior to the superstitions of their
times. Even in the thick darkness of the dark ages, there were minds
too powerful to be kept in chains by error and delusion.</p>

<p>Henry Cornelius Agrippa, who was born in the latter part of the
fifteenth century, was, perhaps, the greatest philosopher and scholar
of his period. In early life, he was very much devoted to the science
of magic, and was a strenuous supporter of demonology and witchcraft.
In the course of his studies and meditations, he was led to a change
of views on these subjects, and did all that he could to warn others
from putting confidence in such vain, frivolous, and absurd
superstitions as then possessed the world. The consequence was, that
he was denounced and prosecuted as a conjurer, and charged with having
written against magic and witchcraft, in order the more securely to
shelter himself from the suspicion of practising them. As an instance
of the calumnies that were heaped upon him, I would mention that
Paulus Jovius asserted that &quot;Cornelius Agrippa went always accompanied
with an evil spirit in the similitude of a black dog;&quot; and that, when
the time of his death drew near, &quot;he took off the enchanted collar
from the dog's neck, and sent him away with these terms, 'Get thee
hence, thou cursed beast, which hast utterly destroyed me:' neither
was the dog ever seen after.&quot; Butler, in his &quot;Hudibras,&quot; has not
neg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[i.368]</a></span>lected to celebrate this remarkable connection between Satan and
the man of learning:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Agrippa kept a Stygian pug<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I' th' garb and habit of a dog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was his tutor; and the cur<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>John Wierus wrote an elaborate, learned, and judicious book, in which
he treated at large of magic, sorcery, and witchcraft, and did all
that scholarship, talent, and philosophy could do to undermine and
subvert the whole system of the prevailing popular superstition. But
he fared no better than his predecessor, patron, and master, Agrippa;
for, like him, he was accused of having attempted to persuade the
world that there was no reality in supernatural charms and diabolical
confederacies, in order that he might devote himself to them without
suspicion or molestation, and was borne down by the bigotry and
fanaticism of his times.</p>

<p>King James merely gave utterance to the general sentiment, and
pronounced the verdict of popular opinion, in the following extract
from the preface to his &quot;Demonologie:&quot; &quot;Wierus, a German physician,
sets out a public apologie for all these crafts-folkes, whereby,
procuring for them impunitie, he plainly bewrays himself to have been
of that profession.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1584, a quarto volume was published in London, the work of Reginald
Scott, a learned English gentleman, whose title sufficiently indicates
its import, &quot;The Discovery of Witchcraft, wherein the lewde dealing
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[i.369]</a></span> witches and witchmongers is notably detected; the knavery of
conjurers, the impiety of inchanters, the folly of soothsayers, the
impudent falsehood of cozeners, the infidelity of atheists, the
pestilent practices of pythonists, the curiosities of figure-casters,
the vanity of dreamers, the beggarly art of alcumstrie, the
abomination of idolatrie, the horrible art of poisoning, the virtue
and power of natural magic, and all the conveniencies of legerdemaine
and juggling, are discovered, &amp;c.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1599, Samuel Harsnett, Archbishop of York, wrote a work, published
in London, to expose certain persons who pretended to have the power
of casting out devils, and detecting their &quot;deceitful trade.&quot; This
writer was among the first to bring the power of bold satire and open
denunciation to bear against the superstitions of demonology. He thus
describes the motives and the methods of such impostors:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Out of these,&quot; saith he, &quot;is shaped us the true idea of a
witch,&#8212;an old, weather-beaten crone, having her chin and
her knees meeting for age, walking like a bow, leaning on a
staff; hollow-eyed, untoothed, furrowed on her face, having
her limbs trembling with the palsy, going mumbling in the
streets; one that hath forgotten her Pater-noster, and yet
hath a shrewd tongue to call a drab a drab. If she hath
learned of an old wife, in a chimney-end, Pax, Max, Fax, for
a spell, or can say Sir John Grantham's curse for the
miller's eels, 'All ye that have stolen the miller's eels,
Laudate dominum de coelis: and all they that have consented
thereto, Benedicamus domino:' why then, beware! look about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[i.370]</a></span>
you, my neighbors. If any of you have a sheep sick of the
giddies, or a hog of the mumps, or a horse of the staggers,
or a knavish boy of the school, or an idle girl of the
wheel, or a young drab of the sullens, and hath not fat
enough for her porridge, or butter enough for her bread, and
she hath a little help of the epilepsy or cramp, to teach
her to roll her eyes, wry her mouth, gnash her teeth,
startle with her body, hold her arms and hands stiff, &amp;c.;
and then, when an old Mother Nobs hath by chance called her
an idle young housewife, or bid the Devil scratch her, then
no doubt but Mother Nobs is the witch, and the young girl is
owl blasted, &amp;c. They that have their brains baited and
their fancies distempered with the imaginations and
apprehensions of witches, conjurers, and fairies, and all
that lymphatic chimera, I find to be marshalled in one of
these five ranks: children, fools, women, cowards, sick or
black melancholic discomposed wits.&quot;</p></div>

<p>In 1669, a work was published in London with the following title: &quot;The
Question of Witchcraft Debated; or, a Discourse against their Opinions
that affirm Witches.&quot; It is a work of great merit, and would do honor
to a scholar and logician of the present day. The author was John
Wagstaffe, of Oxford University: he is described as a crooked,
shrivelled, little man, of a most despicable appearance. This
circumstance, together with his writings against the popular belief in
witchcraft, led his academical associates to accuse him, some of them
in sport, but others with grave suspicion, of being a wizard. Wood,
the historian of Oxford, says that &quot;he died in a manner distracted,
occasioned by a deep conceit of his own parts, and by a continual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[i.371]</a></span>
bibbing of strong and high-tasted liquors.&quot; But poor Wagstaffe was
assailed by something more than private raillery and slander. His
heretical sentiments exposed him to the battery of the host of writers
who will always be found ready to advocate a prevailing opinion. But
Wagstaffe was not left entirely alone to defend the cause of reason
and truth. He had one most zealous advocate and ardent admirer in the
author of a work on &quot;The Doctrine of Devils,&quot; published in 1676. This
writer sums up a panegyric upon Wagstaffe's performance, by
pronouncing it &quot;a judicious book, that contains more good reason, true
religion, and right Christianity, than all those lumps and cartloads
of luggage that hath been fardled up by all the faggeters of
demonologistical winter-tales, and witchcraftical legendaries, since
they first began to foul clean paper.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Balthasar Bekker, of Amsterdam, who was equally eminent in
astronomy, philosophy, and theology, published in 1691 a learned and
powerful work, called &quot;The World Bewitched,&quot; in which he openly
assailed the doctrines of witchcraft and of the Devil, and anticipated
many of the views and arguments presented in Farmer's excellent
publications. As a reward for his exertions to enlighten his
fellow-creatures, he was turned out of the ministry, and assaulted by
nearly all the writers of his age.</p>

<p>Dr. Bekker was one of the ablest and boldest writers of his day, and
did much to advance the cause of natural science, scriptural
interpretation, and the princi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[i.372]</a></span>ples of enlightened Christianity. In
1680 he published an &quot;Inquiry concerning Comets,&quot; rescuing them from
the realm of superstition, placing them within the natural physical
laws, and exploding the then-received opinion, that, in any way, they
are the presages or forerunners of evil. His &quot;Exposition on the
Prophet Daniel&quot; gives proof of his learning and judgment. His great
merits were recognized by John Locke and Richard Bentley. In the
preface to his &quot;World Bewitched,&quot; he says, that it grieved him to see
the great honors, powers, and miracles which are ascribed to the
Devil. &quot;It has come to that pass,&quot; to use his own language, &quot;that men
think it piety and godliness to ascribe a great many wonders to the
Devil, and impiety and heresy, if a man will not believe that the
Devil can do what a thousand persons say he does. It is now reckoned
godliness, if a man who fears God fear also the Devil. If he be not
afraid of the Devil, he passes for an atheist, who does not believe in
God, because he cannot think that there are two gods, the one good,
the other bad. But these, I think, with much more reason, may be
called ditheists. For my part, if, on account of my opinion, they will
give me a new name, let them call me a monotheist, a believer of but
one God.&quot; The work struck down the whole system of demonology and
witchcraft, by proving that there never was really such a thing as
sorcery or possession, and that devils have no influence over human
affairs or the persons of men. It is not surprising that it raised a
great clamor. The wonder is that it did not cost him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[i.373]</a></span> his life. It is
probable that his protection was the confidence the people had in his
character and learning. Attempts were made to diminish that
confidence, and bring him into odium, by levelling against him every
form of abuse. A medal was struck, and extensively circulated,
representing the Devil, clothed like a minister or priest, riding on
an ass. The device was so arranged as to excite ridicule and
abhorrence, in the vulgar mind, against Bekker. But it was found
impossible to turn the popular feeling, which had set in his favor;
and his persecutors and defamers were completely baffled. He was
followed, soon after, by the learned Thomasius, whose writings against
demonology produced a decided effect upon the convictions of the age.</p>

<p>While Bekker, and the other writers of his class, endeavored to
overthrow the superstitious practices and fancies then prevalent
respecting demonology and communications with spiritual beings, they
so far acceded to the popular theology as to maintain the doctrine of
the personality of the Devil. They believed in the existence of the
arch-fiend, but denied his agency in human affairs. They held that he
was kept confined &quot;to bottomless perdition, there to dwell&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;In adamantine chains and penal fire.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sir Robert Filmer, in 1680, published &quot;An Advertisement to the jurymen
of England, touching Witches,&quot; in which he criticised and condemned
many of the opinions and methods then countenanced on the subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[i.374]</a></span></p>

<p>But Bekker, Thomasius, and Filmer appeared too late to operate upon
the prevalent opinions of Europe or America prior to the witchcraft
delusion of 1692. The productions of the other writers, in the same
direction, to whom I have referred, probably had a very limited
circulation, and made at the time but little impression. Error is
seldom overthrown by mere reasoning. It yields only to the logic of
events. No power of learning or wit could have rooted the witchcraft
superstitions out of the minds of men. Nothing short of a
demonstration of their deformities, follies, and horrors, such as here
was held up to the view of the world, could have given their
death-blow. This was the final cause of Salem Witchcraft, and makes it
one of the great landmarks in the world's history.</p>

<p>A full and just view of the position and obligations of the persons
who took part in the transactions at Salem requires a previous
knowledge of the principles and the state of the law, as it was then
in force and understood by the courts, and all concerned in judicial
proceedings. Although the ancients did not regard pretended
intercourse between magicians and enchanters and spiritual beings as
necessarily or always criminal, we find that they enacted laws against
the abuse of the power supposed to result from the connection. The old
Roman code of the Twelve Tables contained the following prohibition:
&quot;That they should not bewitch the fruits of the earth, nor use any
charms, to draw their neighbor's corn into their own fields.&quot; There
were several special edicts on the subject during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[i.375]</a></span> the existence of
the Roman State. In the early Christian councils, sorcery was
frequently made the object of denunciation. At Laodicea, for instance,
in the year 364, it was voted to excommunicate any clergymen who were
magicians, enchanters, astrologers, or mathematicians! The Bull of
Pope Innocent VIII., near the close of the fifteenth century, has
already been mentioned.</p>

<p>Dr. Turner, in his history of the Anglo-Saxons, says that they had
laws against sorcerers and witches, but that they did not punish them
with death. There was an English statute against witchcraft, in the
reign of Henry VIII., and another in that of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Up to this time, however, the legislation of parliament on the subject
was merciful and judicious: for it did not attach to the guilt of
witchcraft the punishment of death, unless it had been used to destroy
life; that is, unless it had become murder.</p>

<p>On the demise of Elizabeth, James of Scotland ascended the throne. His
pedantic and eccentric character is well known. He had an early and
decided inclination towards abstruse or mysterious speculations.
Before he had reached his twentieth year, he undertook to accomplish
what only the most sanguine and profound theologians have ever dared
to attempt: he expounded the Book of Revelation. When he was about
twenty-five years of age, he published a work on the &quot;Doctrine of
Devils and Witchcraft.&quot; Not long after, he succeeded to the British
crown. It may easily be imagined that the subject of demonology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[i.376]</a></span> soon
became a fashionable and prevailing topic of conversation in the royal
saloons and throughout the nation. It served as a medium through which
obsequious courtiers could convey their flattery to the ears of their
accomplished and learned sovereign. His Majesty's book was reprinted
and extensively circulated. It was of course praised and recommended
in all quarters.</p>

<p>The parliament, actuated by a base desire to compliment the vain and
superstitious king, enacted a new and much more severe statute against
witchcraft, in the very first year of his reign. It was under this law
that so many persons here and in England were deprived of their lives.
The blood of hundreds of innocent persons was thus unrighteously shed.
It was a fearful price which these servile lawgivers paid for the
favor of their prince.</p>

<p>But this was not the only mischief brought about by courtly deference
to the prejudices of King James. It was under his direction that our
present translation of the Scriptures was made. To please His Royal
Majesty, and to strengthen the arguments in his work on demonology,
the word &quot;witch&quot; was used to represent expressions in the original
Hebrew, that conveyed an entirely different idea; and it was freely
inserted in the headings of the chapters.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> A person having &quot;a
familiar spirit&quot; was a favorite description of a witch in the king's
book. The trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[i.377]</a></span>lators, forgetful of their high and solemn function,
endeavored to establish this definition by inserting it into their
version. Accordingly, they introduced it in several places; in the
eleventh verse of the eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, for instance,
&quot;a consulter with familiar spirits.&quot; There is no word in the Hebrew
which corresponds with &quot;familiar.&quot; And this is the important, the
essential word in the definition. It conveys the idea of alliance,
stated connection, confederacy, or compact, which is characteristic
and distinctive of a witch. The expression in the original signifies
&quot;a consulter with spirits,&quot;&#8212;especially, as was the case with the
&quot;Witch of Endor,&quot; a consulter with departed spirits. It was a shocking
perversion of the word of God, for the purpose of flattering a frail
and mortal sovereign! King James lived to see and acknowledge the
error of his early opinions, and he would gladly have counteracted
their bad effect; but it is easier to make laws and translations than
it is to alter and amend them.</p>

<p>While the law of the land required the capital punishment of witches,
no blame ought to be attached to judges and jurors for discharging
their respective duties in carrying it into execution. It will not do
for us to assert, that they ought to have refused, let the
consequences to themselves have been what they would, to sanction and
give effect to such inhuman and unreasonable enactments. We cannot
consistently take this ground; for there is nothing more certain than
that, with their notions, our ancestors had at least as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[i.378]</a></span> good reasons
to advance in favor of punishing witchcraft with death, as we have for
punishing any crime whatsoever in the same awful and summary manner.
We appeal, in defence of our capital punishments, to the text of
Moses, &quot;Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.&quot;
The apologist of our fathers, for carrying into effect the law making
witchcraft a capital offence, tells us in reply, in the first place,
that this passage is not of the nature of a precept, but merely of an
admonition; that it does not enjoin any particular method of
proceeding, but simply describes the natural consequences of cruel and
contentious conduct; and that it amounts only to this: that
quarrelsome, violent, and bloodthirsty persons will be apt to meet the
same fate they bring upon others; that the duellist will be likely to
fall in private combat, the ambitious conqueror to perish, and the
warlike nation to be destroyed, on the field of battle. If this is not
considered by us a sufficient and satisfactory answer, he advances to
our own ground, points to the same text where we place our defence,
and puts his finger on the following plain and authoritative precept:
&quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&quot; Indeed we must acknowledge,
that the capital punishment of witches is as strongly supported and
fortified by the Scriptures of the Old Testament&#8212;at least, as they
appear in our present version&#8212;as the capital punishment of any crime
whatever.</p>

<p>If we adopt another line of argument, and say that it is necessary to
punish some particular crimes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[i.379]</a></span> death, in order to maintain the
security of society, or hold up an impressive warning to others, here
also we find that our opponent has full as much to offer in defence of
our fathers as can be offered in our own defence. He describes to us
the tremendous and infernal power which was universally believed by
them to be possessed by a witch; a power which, as it was not derived
from a natural source, could not easily be held in check by natural
restraints: neither chains nor dungeons could bind it down or confine
it. You might load the witch with irons, you might bury her in the
lowest cell of a feudal prison, and still it was believed that she
could send forth her imps or her spectre to ravage the fields, and
blight the meadows, and throw the elements into confusion, and torture
the bodies, and craze the minds, of any who might be the objects of
her malice.</p>

<p>Shakspeare, in the description which he puts into the mouth of Macbeth
of the supernatural energy of witchcraft, does not surpass, if he does
justice to, the prevailing belief on the subject:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;I conjure you, by that which you profess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Howe'er you came to know it) answer me,&#8212;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though you untie the winds, and let them fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the churches; though the yesty waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confound and swallow navigation up;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though bladed corn be lodged, and trees blown down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though castles topple on their warders' heads;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though palaces and pyramids do slope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nature's germins tumble all together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even till destruction sicken,&#8212;answer me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what I ask you.&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[i.380]</a></span></div></div>

<p>There was indeed an almost infinite power to do mischief associated
with a disposition to do it. No human strength could strip the witch
of these mighty energies while she lived; nothing but death could
destroy them. There was, as our ancestors considered, incontestable
evidence, that she had put them forth to the injury, loss, and perhaps
death, of others.</p>

<p>Can it be wondered at, that, under such circumstances, the law
connecting capital punishment with the guilt of witchcraft was
resorted to as the only means to protect society, and warn others from
entering into the dark, wicked, and malignant compact?</p>

<p>It is not probable that even King James's Parliament would have been
willing to go to the length of Selden in his &quot;Table-Talk,&quot; who takes
this ground in defence of the capital punishment of witches. &quot;The law
against witches does not prove there be any, but it punishes the
malice of those people that use such means to take away men's lives.
If one should profess, that, by turning his hat thrice and crying
'Buzz,' he could take away a man's life (though in truth he could do
no such thing), yet this were a just law made by the State, that
whoever should turn his hat thrice and cry 'Buzz,' with an intention
to take away a man's life, shall be put to death.&quot;</p>

<p>There are other considerations that deserve to be weighed before a
final judgment should be made up respecting the conduct of our fathers
in the witchcraft delusion. Among these is the condition of physical
science in their day. But little knowledge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[i.381]</a></span> laws of nature was
possessed, and that little was confined to a few. The world was still,
to the mass of the people, almost as full of mystery in its physical
departments as it was to its first inhabitants. Politics, poetry,
rhetoric, ethics, and history had been cultivated to a great extent in
previous ages; but the philosophy of the natural and material world
was almost unknown. Astronomy, chemistry, optics, pneumatics, and even
geography, were involved in the general darkness and error. Some of
our most important sciences, such as electricity, date their origin
from a later period.</p>

<p>This remarkable tardiness in the progress of physical science for some
time after the era of the revival of learning is to be accounted for
by referring to the erroneous methods of reasoning and observation
then prevalent in the world. A false logic was adopted in the schools
of learning and philosophy. The great instrument for the discovery and
investigation of truth was the syllogism, the most absurd contrivance
of the human mind; an argumentative process whose conclusion is
contained in the premises; a method of proof, in the first step of
which the matter to be proved is taken for granted.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> In a word, the
whole system of philosophy was made up of hypotheses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[i.382]</a></span> the only
foundation of science was laid in conjecture. The imagination, called
necessarily into extraordinary action, in the absence of scientific
certainty, was still further exercised in vain attempts to discover,
unassisted by observation and experiment, the elements and first
principles of nature. It had reached a monstrous growth about the time
to which we are referring. Indeed it may be said, that all the
intellectual productions of modern times, from the seventeenth century
back to the dark ages, were works of imagination. The bulkiest and
most voluminous writings that proceeded from the cloisters or the
universities, even the metaphysical disquisitions of the Nominalists
and Realists, and the boundless subtleties of the contending schools
of the &quot;Divine Doctors,&quot; Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus, fall under
this description. Dull, dreary, unintelligible, and interminable as
they are, they are still in reality works of fancy. They are the
offspring, almost exclusively, of the imaginative faculty. It ought
not to create surprise, to find that this faculty predominated in the
minds and characters of our ancestors, and developed itself to an
extent beyond our conception, when we reflect that it was almost the
only one called into exercise, and that it was the leading element of
every branch of literature and philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[i.383]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true, that, in the earlier part of the seventeenth century, Lord
Bacon made his sublime discoveries in the department of physical
science. By disclosing the true method of investigation and reasoning
on such subjects, he may be said to have found, or rather to have
invented, the key that unlocked the hitherto unopened halls of nature.
He introduced man to the secret chambers of the universe, and placed
in his hand the thread by which he has been conducted to the
magnificent results of modern science, and will undoubtedly be led on
to results still more magnificent in times to come. But it was not for
human nature to pass in a moment from darkness to light. The
transition was slow and gradual: a long twilight intervened before the
sun shed its clear and full radiance upon the world.</p>

<p>The great discoverer himself refused to admit, or was unable to
discern, some of the truths his system had revealed. Bacon was
numbered among the opponents of the Copernican or true system of
astronomy to the day of his death; so also was Sir Thomas Browne, the
great philosopher already described, and who flourished during the
latter half of the same century. Indeed, it may be said, that, at the
time of the witchcraft delusion, the ancient empire of darkness which
had oppressed and crushed the world of science had hardly been shaken.
The great and triumphant progress of modern discovery had scarcely
begun.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to illustrate these views of the state of science
in the world at that time by presenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[i.384]</a></span> a few instances. The
slightest examination of the accounts which remain of occurrences
deemed supernatural by our ancestors will satisfy any one that they
were brought about by causes entirely natural, although unknown to
them. For instance, the following circumstances are related by the
Rev. James Pierpont, pastor of a church in New Haven, in a letter to
Cotton Mather, and published by him in his &quot;Magnalia:&quot;<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>&#8212;</p>

<p>In the year 1646, a new ship, containing a valuable cargo, and having
several distinguished persons on board as passengers, put to sea from
New Haven in the month of January, bound to England. The vessels that
came over the ensuing spring brought no tidings of her arrival in the
mother-country. The pious colonists were earnest and instant in their
prayers that intelligence might be received of the missing vessel. In
the month of June, 1648, &quot;a great thunder-storm arose out of the
north-west; after which (the hemisphere being serene), about an hour
before sunset, a ship of like dimensions with the aforesaid, with her
canvas and colors abroad (although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[i.385]</a></span> the wind was northerly), appeared
in the air, coming up from the harbor's mouth, which lies southward
from the town,&#8212;seemingly with her sails filled under a fresh gale,
holding her course north, and continuing under observation, sailing
against the wind for the space of half an hour.&quot; The phantom-ship was
borne along, until, to the excited imaginations of the spectators, she
seemed to have approached so near that they could throw a stone into
her. Her main-topmast then disappeared, then her mizzen-topmast; then
her masts were entirely carried away; and, finally, her hull fell off,
and vanished from sight,&#8212;leaving a dull and smoke-colored cloud,
which soon dissolved, and the whole atmosphere became clear. All
affirmed that the airy vision was a precise copy and image of the
missing vessel, and that it was sent to announce and describe her
fate. They considered it the spectre of the lost ship; and the Rev.
Mr. Davenport declared in public, &quot;that God had condescended, for the
quieting their afflicted spirits, this extraordinary account of his
sovereign disposal of those for whom so many fervent prayers were made
continually.&quot;</p>

<p>The results of modern science enable us to explain the mysterious
appearance. It is probable that some Dutch vessel, proceeding slowly,
quietly, and unconsciously on her voyage from Amsterdam to the New
Netherlands, happened at the time to be passing through the Sound. At
the moment the apparition was seen in the sky, she was so near, that
her reflected image was painted or delineated, to the eyes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[i.386]</a></span>
observers, on the clouds, by laws of optics now generally well known,
before her actual outlines could be discerned by them on the horizon.
As the sun sunk behind the western hills, and his rays were gradually
withdrawn, the visionary ship slowly disappeared; and the approach of
night effectually concealed the vessel as she continued her course
along the Sound.</p>

<p>The optical illusions that present themselves on the sea-shore, by
which distant objects are raised to view, the opposite capes and
islands made to loom up, lifted above the line of the apparent
circumference of the earth, and thrown into every variety of shape
which the imagination can conceive, are among the most beautiful
phenomena of nature; and they impress the mind with the idea of
enchantment and mystery, more perhaps than any others: but they have
received a complete solution from modern discovery.</p>

<p>It should be observed, that the optical principles which explain these
phenomena have recently afforded a foundation for the science, or
rather art, of nauscopy; and there are persons in some places,&#8212;in the
Isle of France, as I have been told,&#8212;whose calling and profession is
to ascertain and predict the approach of vessels, by their reflection
in the atmosphere and on the clouds, long before they are visible to
the eye, or through the glass.</p>

<p>The following opinion prevailed at the time of our narrative. The
discoveries in electricity, itself a recent science, have rendered it
impossible for us to contemplate it without ridicule. But it was the
sober<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[i.387]</a></span> opinion of the age. &quot;A great man has noted it,&quot; says a learned
writer, &quot;that thunders break oftener on churches than any other
houses, because demons have a peculiar spite at houses that are set
apart for the peculiar service of God.&quot;</p>

<p>Every thing that was strange or remarkable&#8212;every thing at all out of
the usual course, every thing that was not clear and plain&#8212;was
attributed to supernatural interposition. Indeed, our fathers lived,
as they thought, continually in the midst of miracles; and felt
themselves surrounded, at all times, in all scenes, with innumerable
invisible beings. The beautiful verse of Milton describes their
faith:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What was to him, however, a momentary vision of the imagination, was
to them like a perpetual perception of the senses: it was a practical
belief, an everyday common sentiment, an all-pervading feeling. But
these supernatural beings very frequently were believed to have become
visible to our superstitious ancestors. The instances, indeed, were
not rare, of individuals having seen the Devil himself with their
mortal eyes. They may well be brought to notice, as illustrating the
ideas which then prevailed, and had an immediate, practical effect on
the conduct of men, in reference to the power, presence, and action of
the Devil in human affairs. This, in fact, is necessary, that we may
understand the narrative we are preparing to contemplate of
transactions based wholly on those ideas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[i.388]</a></span></p>

<p>The following passage is extracted from a letter written to Increase
Mather by the Rev. John Higginson:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;The godly Mr. Sharp, who was ruling elder of the church of
Salem almost thirty years after, related it of himself,
that, being bred up to learning till he was eighteen years
old, and then taken off, and put to be an apprentice to a
draper in London, he yet notwithstanding continued a strong
inclination and eager affection to books, with a curiosity
of hearkening after and reading of the strangest and oddest
books he could get, spending much of his time that way to
the neglect of his business. At one time, there came a man
into the shop, and brought a book with him, and said to him,
'Here is a book for you, keep this till I call for it
again;' and so went away. Mr. Sharp, after his wonted
bookish manner, was eagerly affected to look into that book,
and read it, which he did: but, as he read in it, he was
seized on by a strange kind of horror, both of body and
mind, the hair of his head standing up; and, finding these
effects several times, he acquainted his master with it,
who, observing the same effects, they concluded it was a
conjuring book, and resolved to burn it, which they did. He
that brought it in the shape of a man never coming to call
for it, they concluded it was the Devil. He, taking this as
a solemn warning from God to take heed what books he read,
was much taken off from his former bookishness; confining
himself to reading the Bible, and other known good books of
divinity, which were profitable to his soul.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Kircher relates the following anecdote, with a full belief of its
truth: He had a friend who was zealously and perseveringly devoted to
the study of al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[i.389]</a></span>chemy. At one time, while he was intent upon his
operations, a gentleman entered his laboratory, and kindly offered to
assist him. In a few moments, a large mass of the purest gold was
brought forth from the crucible. The gentleman then took his hat, and
went out: before leaving the apartment, however, he wrote a recipe for
making the precious article. The grateful and admiring mortal
continued his operations, according to the directions of his visitor;
but the charm was lost: he could not succeed, and was at last
completely ruined by his costly and fruitless experiments. Both he and
his friend Kircher were fully persuaded that the mysterious
stranger-visitor was the Devil.</p>

<p>Baxter has recorded a curious interview between Satan and Mr. White,
of Dorchester, assessor to the Westminster Assembly:&#8212;</p>

<p>&quot;The Devil, in a light night, stood by his bedside. The assessor
looked a while, whether he would say or do any thing, and then said,
'If thou hast nothing to do, I have;' and so turned himself to sleep.&quot;
Dr. Hibbert is of opinion, that the Rev. Mr. White treated his satanic
majesty, on this occasion, with &quot;a cool contempt, to which he had not
often been accustomed.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, there is nothing more curious or instructive, in the history
of that period, than the light which it sheds upon the influence of
the belief of the personal existence and operations of the Devil, when
that belief is carried out fully into its practical effects. The
Christian doctrine had relapsed into a system almost identical with
Manicheism. Wierus thus describes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[i.390]</a></span> Satan, as he was regarded in the
prevalent theology: &quot;He possesses great courage, incredible cunning,
superhuman wisdom, the most acute penetration, consummate prudence, an
incomparable skill in veiling the most pernicious artifices under a
specious disguise, and a malicious and infinite hatred towards the
human race, implacable and incurable.&quot; Milton merely responded to the
popular sentiment in making Satan a character of lofty dignity, and in
placing him on an elevation not &quot;less than archangel ruined.&quot;
Hallywell, in his work on witchcraft, declares that &quot;that mighty angel
of darkness is not foolishly nor idly to be scoffed at or blasphemed.
The Devil,&quot; says he, &quot;may properly be looked upon as a dignity, though
his glory be pale and wan, and those once bright and orient colors
faded and darkened in his robes; and the Scriptures represent him as a
prince, though it be of devils.&quot; Although our fathers cannot be
charged with having regarded the Devil in this respectful and
deferential light, it must be acknowledged that they gave him a
conspicuous and distinguished&#8212;we might almost say a dignified&#8212;agency
in the affairs of life and the government of the world: they were
prone to confess, if not to revere, his presence, in all scenes and at
all times. He occupied a wide space, not merely in their theology and
philosophy, but in their daily and familiar thoughts.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[i.391]</a></span></p>

<p>Cotton Mather, in one of his sermons, carries home this peculiar
belief to the consciences of his hearers, in a manner that could not
have failed to quicken and startle the most dull and drowsy among
them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;No place,&quot; says he, &quot;that I know of, has got such a spell
upon it as will always keep the Devil out. The
meeting-house, wherein we assemble for the worship of God,
is filled with many holy people and many holy concerns
continually; but, if our eyes were so refined as the servant
of the prophet had his of old, I suppose we should now see a
throng of devils in this very place. The apostle has
intimated that angels come in among us: there are angels, it
seems, that hark how I preach, and how you hear, at this
hour. And our own sad experience is enough to intimate that
the devils are likewise rendezvousing here. It is reported
in Job i. 5, 'When the sons of God came to present
themselves before the Lord, Satan came also among them.'
When we are in our church assemblies, oh, how many devils,
do you imagine, crowd in among us! There is a devil that
rocks one to sleep. There is a devil that makes another to
be thinking of, he scarcely knows what himself. And there is
a devil that makes another to be pleasing himself with
wanton and wicked speculations. It is also possible, that we
have our closets or our studies gloriously perfumed with
devotions every day; but, alas! can we shut the Devil out of
them? No: let us go where we will, we shall still find a
devil nigh unto us. Only when we come to heaven, we shall be
out of his reach for ever.&quot;</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[i.392]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very remarkable, that such a train of thought as this did not
suggest to the mind of Dr. Mather the true doctrine of the Bible
respecting the Devil. One would have supposed, that, in carrying out
the mode of speaking of him as a person to this extent, it would have
occurred to him, that it might be that the scriptural expressions of a
similar kind were also mere personifications of moral and abstract
ideas. In describing the inattention, irreverence, and unholy
reflections of his hearers as the operations of the Devil, it is
wonderful that his eyes were not opened to discern the import of our
Saviour's interpretation of the Parable of the Tares, in which he
declares, that he understands by the Devil whatever obstructs the
growth of virtue and piety in the soul, the causes that efface good
impressions and give a wrong inclination to the thoughts and
affections, such as &quot;the cares of this world&quot; or &quot;the deceitfulness of
riches.&quot; By these are the tares planted, and by these is their growth
promoted. &quot;The enemy that sowed them is the Devil.&quot;</p>

<p>Satan was regarded as the foe and opposer of all improvement in
knowledge and civilization. The same writer thus quaintly expresses
this opinion: He &quot;has hindered mankind, for many ages, from hitting
those useful inventions which yet were so obvious and facile that it
is everybody's wonder that they were not sooner hit upon. The bemisted
world must jog on for thousands of years without the knowledge of the
loadstone, till a Neapolitan stumbled upon it about three hundred
years ago. Nor must the world be blessed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[i.393]</a></span> such a matchless engine
of learning and virtue as that of printing, till about the middle of
the fifteenth century. Nor could one old man, all over the face of the
whole earth, have the benefit of such a little, though most needful,
thing as a pair of spectacles, till a Dutchman, a little while ago,
accommodated us. Indeed, as the Devil does begrudge us all manner of
good, so he does annoy us with all manner of woe.&quot; In one of his
sermons, Cotton Mather claimed for himself and his clerical brethren
the honor of being particularly obnoxious to the malice of the Evil
One. &quot;The ministers of God,&quot; says he, &quot;are more dogged by the Devil
than other persons are.&quot;</p>

<p>Without a knowledge of this sentiment, the witchcraft delusion of our
fathers cannot be understood. They were under an impression, that the
Devil, having failed to prevent the progress of knowledge in Europe,
had abandoned his efforts to obstruct it effectually there; had
withdrawn into the American wilderness, intending here to make a final
stand; and had resolved to retain an undiminished empire over the
whole continent and his pagan allies, the native inhabitants. Our
fathers accounted for the extraordinary descent and incursions of the
Evil One among them, in 1692, on the supposition that it was a
desperate effort to prevent them from bringing civilization and
Christianity within his favorite retreat; and their souls were fired
with the glorious thought, that, by carrying on the war with vigor
against him and his confederates, the witches, they would become
chosen and honored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[i.394]</a></span> instruments in the hand of God for breaking down
and abolishing the last stronghold on the earth of the kingdom of
darkness.</p>

<p>That this opinion was not merely a conceit of their vanity, or an
overweening estimate of their local importance, but a calm, deliberate
conviction entertained by others as well as themselves, can be shown
by abundant evidence from the literature of that period. I will quote
a single illustration of the form in which this thought occupied their
minds. The subject is worthy of being thoroughly appreciated, as it
affords the key that opens to view the motives and sentiments which
gave the mighty impetus to the witchcraft prosecution here in New
England.</p>

<p>Joseph Mede, B.D., Fellow of Christ's College, in Cambridge, England,
died in 1638, at the age of fifty-three years. He was perhaps, all
things considered, the most profound scholar of his times. His
writings give evidence of a brilliant genius and an enlightened
spirit. They were held in the highest esteem by his contemporaries of
all denominations, and in all parts of Europe. He was a Churchman; but
had, to a remarkable degree, the confidence of nonconformists. He
entertained, as will appear by what follows, in the boldest form, the
then prevalent opinions concerning diabolical agency and influence;
but, at the same time, was singularly free from some of the worst
traits of superstition and bigotry. His intimacy with the learned Dr.
William Ames, and the general tone and tendency of his writings,
naturally made him an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[i.395]</a></span> authority with Protestants, particularly the
Pilgrims and Puritans of New England. His posthumous writings,
published in 1652, are exceedingly interesting. They contain fragments
found among his papers, brief discussions of points of criticism,
philosophy, and theology, and a varied correspondence on such subjects
with eminent men of his day. Among his principal correspondents was
Dr. William Twiss, himself a person of much ingenious learning, and
whom John Norton, as we are told by Cotton Mather, &quot;loved and admired&quot;
above all men of that age. The following passages between them
illustrate the point before us.</p>

<p>In a letter dated March 2, 1634, Twiss writes thus:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Now, I beseech you, let me know what your opinion is of our
English plantations in the New World. Heretofore, I have
wondered in my thoughts at the providence of God concerning
that world; not discovered till this Old World of ours is
almost at an end; and then no footsteps found of the
knowledge of the true God, much less of Christ; and then
considering our English plantations of late, and the opinion
of many grave divines concerning the gospel's fleeting
westward. Sometimes I have had such thoughts, Why may not
<i>that</i> be the place of the <i>New Jerusalem</i>? But you have
handsomely and fully cleared me from such odd conceits. But
what, I pray? Shall our English there degenerate, and join
themselves with Gog and Magog? We have heard lately divers
ways, that our people there have no hope of the conversion
of the natives. And, the very week after I received your
last letter, I saw a letter, written from New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[i.396]</a></span> England,
discoursing of an impossibility of subsisting there; and
seems to prefer the confession of God's truth in any
condition here in Old England, rather than run over to enjoy
their liberty there; yea, and that the gospel is like to be
more dear in New England than in Old. And, lastly, unless
they be exceeding careful, and God wonderfully merciful,
they are like to lose that life and zeal for God and his
truth in New England which they enjoyed in Old; as whereof
they have already woful experience, and many there feel it
to their smart.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Mr. Mede's answer was as follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Concerning our plantations in the American world, I wish
them as well as anybody; though I differ from them far, both
in other things, and on the grounds they go upon. And though
there be but little hope of the general conversion of those
natives or any considerable part of that continent, yet I
suppose it may be a work pleasing to Almighty God and our
blessed Saviour to affront the Devil with the sound of the
gospel and the cross of Christ, in those places where he had
thought to have reigned securely, and out of the din
thereof; and, though we make no Christians there, yet to
bring some thither to disturb and vex him, where he reigned
without check.</p>

<p>&quot;For that I may reveal my conceit further, though perhaps I
cannot prove it, yet I think thus,&#8212;that those countries
were first inhabited since our Saviour and his apostles'
times, and not before; yea, perhaps, some ages after, there
being no signs or footsteps found among them, or any
monuments of older habitation, as there is with us.</p>

<p>&quot;That the Devil, being impatient of the sound of the gospel
and cross of Christ, in every part of this Old World,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[i.397]</a></span> so
that he could in no place be quiet for it; and foreseeing
that he was like to lose all here; so he thought to provide
himself of a seed over which he might reign securely, and in
a place <i>ubi nec Pelopidarum facta neque nomen audiret</i>.
That, accordingly, he drew a colony out of some of those
barbarous nations dwelling upon the Northern Ocean (whither
the sound of Christ had not yet come), and promising them by
some oracle to show them a country far better than their own
(which he might soon do), pleasant and large, where never
man yet inhabited; he conducted them over those desert lands
and islands (of which there are many in that sea) by the way
of the north into America, which none would ever have gone,
had they not first been assured there was a passage that way
into a more desirable country. Namely, as when the world
apostatized from the worship of the true God, God called
Abraham out of Chaldee into the land of Canaan, of him to
raise a seed to preserve a light unto his name: so the
Devil, when he saw the world apostatizing from him, laid the
foundations of a new kingdom, by deducting this colony from
the north into America, where they have increased since into
an innumerable multitude. And where did the Devil ever reign
more absolutely, and without control, since mankind first
fell under his clutches?</p>

<p>&quot;And here it is to be noted, that the story of the Mexican
kingdom (which was not founded above four hundred years
before ours came thither) relates, out of their own
memorials and traditions, that they came to that place from
the <i>north</i>, whence their god, <i>Vitziliputzli</i>, led them,
going in an ark before them: and, after divers years' travel
and many stations (like enough after some generations), they
came to the place which the sign he had given them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[i.398]</a></span> their
first setting-forth pointed out; where they were to finish
their travels, build themselves a <i>city</i>, and their god a
<i>temple</i>, which is the place where Mexico was built. Now, if
the Devil were God's ape in <i>this</i>, why might he not be
likewise in bringing the first colony of men into that world
out of ours? namely, by oracle, as God did Abraham out of
Chaldee, whereto I before resembled it.</p>

<p>&quot;But see the hand of Divine Providence. When the offspring
of these <i>runagates</i> from the sound of Christ's gospel had
now replenished that other world, and began to flourish in
those two kingdoms of Peru and Mexico, Christ our Lord sends
his mastives, the Spaniards, to hunt them out, and worry
them; which they did in so hideous a manner, as the like
thereunto scarce ever was done since the sons of Noah came
out of the ark. What an affront to the Devil was this, where
he had thought to have reigned securely, and been for ever
concealed from the knowledge of the followers of Christ!</p>

<p>&quot;Yet the Devil perhaps is <i>less grieved</i> for the loss of his
servants by the <i>destroying</i> of them, than he would be to
lose them by the <i>saving</i> of them; by which latter way, I
doubt the Spaniards have despoiled him but of a few. What,
then, if Christ our Lord will give him his <i>second affront</i>
with better Christians, which may be more grievous to him
than the former? And, if Christ shall set him up a light in
this manner to dazzle and torment the Devil at his own home,
I hope they (viz., the Americans) shall not so far
degenerate (not all of them) as to come into that army of
Gog and Magog against the kingdom of Christ, but be
translated thither before the Devil be loosed; if not,
presently after his tying up.&quot;</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[i.399]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Twiss, in a reply to the above, dated April 6, 1635, thanks Mede
for his letter, which he says he read &quot;with recreation and delight;&quot;
and, particularly in reference to the &quot;peopling of the New World,&quot; he
affirms that there is &quot;more in this letter of yours than formerly I
have been acquainted with. Your conceit thereabouts, if I have any
judgment, is grave and ponderous.&quot;</p>

<p>This correspondence, while it serves as a specimen of the style of
Mede, is a remarkable instance of the power of a sagacious intellect
to penetrate through the darkness of theoretical and fanciful errors,
and behold the truth that lies behind and beyond. The whole
superstructure of the Devil, his oracles, and his schemes of policy
and dominion, covers, in this brief familiar epistle, what is, I
suppose, the theory most accredited at this day of the origin and
traduction of the aboriginal races of America, proceeding from the
nearest portions of the ancient continent on the North, and advancing
down over the vast spaces towards Central and South America. The
letter also foreshadows the decisive conflict which is here to be
waged between the elements of freedom and slavery, between social and
political systems that will rescue and exalt humanity, and those which
depress and degrade it. In the phraseology of that age, it was to be
determined whether&#8212;the Old World, in the language of Twiss, &quot;being
almost at an end&quot;&#8212;a &quot;light&quot; should be &quot;set up&quot; here to usher in the
&quot;kingdom of Christ,&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[i.400]</a></span> or America also be for ever given over to the
&quot;army of Gog and Magog.&quot;</p>

<p>Our fathers were justified in feeling that this was the sense of their
responsibility entertained by all learned men and true Christians in
the Old World; and they were ready to meet and discharge it faithfully
and manfully. They were told, and they believed, that it had fallen to
their lot to be the champions of the cross of Christ against the power
of the Devil. They felt, as I have said, that they were fighting him
in his last stronghold, and they were determined to &quot;tie him up&quot; for
ever.</p>

<p>This is the true and just explanation of their general policy of
administration, in other matters, as well as in the witchcraft
prosecutions.</p>

<p>The conclusion to which we are brought, by a review of the seventeenth
century up to the period when the prosecutions took place here, is,
that the witchcraft delusion pervaded the whole civilized world and
every profession and department of society. It received the sanction
of all the learned and distinguished English judges who flourished
within the century, from Sir Edward Coke to Sir Matthew Hale. It was
countenanced by the greatest philosophers and physicians, and was
embraced by men of the highest genius and accomplishments, even by
Lord Bacon himself. It was established by the convocation of bishops,
and preached by the clergy. Dr. Henry More, of Christ's College,
Cambridge, in addition to his admirable poetical and philosophical
works, wrote volumes to defend it. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[i.401]</a></span> was considered as worthy of the
study of the most cultivated and liberal minds to discover and
distinguish &quot;a true witch by proper trials and symptoms.&quot; The
excellent Dr. Calamy has already been mentioned in this connection;
and Richard Baxter wrote his work entitled &quot;The Certainty of the World
of Spirits,&quot; for the special purpose of confirming and diffusing the
belief. He kept up a correspondence with Cotton Mather, and with his
father, Increase Mather, through the medium of which he stimulated and
encouraged them in their proceedings against supposed witches in
Boston and elsewhere. The divines of that day seem to have persuaded
themselves into the belief that the doctrines of demonology were
essential to the gospel, and that the rejection of them was equivalent
to infidelity. A writer in one of our modern journals, in speaking of
the prosecutions for witchcraft, happily and justly observes, &quot;It was
truly hazardous to oppose those judicial murders. If any one ventured
to do so, the Catholics burned him as a heretic, and the Protestants
had a vehement longing to hang him for an atheist.&quot; The writings of
Dr. More, of Baxter, Glanvil, Perkins, and others, had been
circulating for a long time in New England before the trials began at
Salem. It was such a review of the history of opinion as we have now
made, which led Dr. Bentley to declare that &quot;the agency of invisible
beings, if not a part of every religion, is not contrary to any one.
It may be found in all ages, and in the most remote countries. It is
then no just subject for our admiration, that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[i.402]</a></span> belief so alarming to
our fears, so natural to our prejudices, and so easily abused by
superstition, should obtain among our fathers, when it had not been
rejected in the ages of philosophy, letters, and even revelation.&quot;</p>

<p>The works on demonology, the legal proceedings in prosecutions, and
the phraseology of the people, gave more or less definite form to
certain prominent points which may be summarily noticed. Several terms
and expressions were employed to characterize persons supposed to be
conversant with supernatural and magic art; such as diviner,
enchanter, charmer, conjurer, necromancer, fortune-teller, soothsayer,
augur, and sorcerer. These words are sometimes used as more or less
synonymous, although, strictly speaking, they have meanings quite
distinct. But none of them convey the idea attached to the name of
witch. It was sometimes especially used to signify a female, while
wizard was exclusively applied to a male. The distinction was not,
however, often attempted to be made; the former title being
prevailingly applied to either sex. A witch was regarded as a person
who had made an actual, deliberate, formal compact with Satan, by
which it was agreed that she should become his faithful subject, and
do all in her power to aid him in his rebellion against God and his
warfare against the gospel and church of Christ; and, in consideration
of such allegiance and service, Satan, on his part, agreed to exercise
his supernatural powers in her favor, and communicate to her those
powers, in a greater or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[i.403]</a></span> degree, as she proved herself an
efficient and devoted supporter of his cause. Thus, a witch was
considered as a person who had transferred allegiance and worship from
God to the Devil.</p>

<p>The existence of this compact was supposed to confer great additional
power on the Devil, as well as on his new subject; for the doctrine
seems to have prevailed, that, for him to act with effect upon men,
the intervention, instrumentality, and co-operation of human beings
was necessary; and almost unlimited potency was ascribed to the
combined exertions of Satan and those persons in league with him. A
witch was believed to have the power, through her compact with the
Devil, of afflicting, distressing, and rending whomsoever she would.
She could cause them to pine away, throw them into the most frightful
convulsions, choke, bruise, pierce, and craze them, subjecting them to
every description of pain, disease, and torture, and even to death
itself. She was believed to possess the faculty of being present, in
her shape or apparition, at a different place, at any distance
whatever, from that which her actual body occupied. Indeed, an
indefinite amount of supernatural ability, and a boundless freedom and
variety of methods for its exercise, were supposed to result from the
diabolical compact. Those upon whom she thus exercised her malignant
and mysterious energies were said to be bewitched.</p>

<p>Beside these infernal powers, the alliance with Satan was believed to
confer knowledge such as no other mortal possessed. The witch could
perform the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[i.404]</a></span> wonders, in giving information of the things that
belong to the invisible world, which is alleged in our day, by
spirit-rappers, to be received through mediums. She could read inmost
thoughts, suggest ideas to the minds of the absent, throw temptations
in the path of those whom she desired to delude and destroy, bring up
the spirits of the departed, and hear from them the secrets of their
lives and of their deaths, and their experiences in the scenes of
being on which they entered at their departure from this.</p>

<p>When we consider that these opinions were not merely prevalent among
the common people, but sanctioned by learning and philosophy, science
and jurisprudence; that they possessed an authority, which but few
ventured to question and had been firmly established by the
convictions of centuries,&#8212;none can be surprised at the alarm it
created, when the belief became current, that there were those in the
community, and even in the churches, who had actually entered into
this dark confederacy against God and heaven, religion and virtue; and
that individuals were beginning to suffer from their diabolical power.
It cannot be considered strange, that men looked with more than common
horror upon persons against whom what was regarded as overwhelming
evidence was borne of having engaged in this conspiracy with all that
was evil, and this treason against all that was good.</p>

<p>Elaborate works, scientific, philosophical, and judicial in their
pretensions and reputation,&#8212;to some of which reference has been
made,&#8212;defined and par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[i.405]</a></span>ticularized the various forms of evidence by
which the crime of confederacy with Satan could be proved.</p>

<p>It was believed that the Devil affixed his mark to the bodies of those
in alliance with him, and that the point where this mark was made
became callous and dead. The law provided, specifically, the means of
detecting and identifying this sign. It required that the prisoner
should be subjected to the scrutiny of a jury of the same sex, who
would make a minute inspection of the body, shaving the head and
handling every part. They would pierce it with pins; and if, as might
have been expected, particularly in aged persons, any spot could be
found insensible to the torture, or any excrescence, induration, or
fixed discoloration, it was looked upon as visible evidence and
demonstration of guilt. A physician or &quot;chirurgeon&quot; was required to be
present at these examinations. In conducting them, there was liability
to great roughness and unfeeling recklessness of treatment; and the
whole procedure was barbarous and shocking to every just and delicate
sensibility. There is reason to believe, that, in the trials here,
there was more considerateness, humanity, and regard to a sense of
decent propriety, than in similar proceedings in other countries, so
far as this branch of the investigation is regarded.</p>

<p>Another accredited field of evidence, recognized in the books and in
legal proceedings, was as follows: It was believed, that, when witches
found it inconvenient from any cause to execute their infernal designs
upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[i.406]</a></span> those whom they wished to afflict by going to them in their
natural human persons, they transformed themselves into the likeness
of some animal,&#8212;a dog, hog, cat, rat, mouse, or toad;
birds&#8212;particularly yellow birds&#8212;were often imagined to perform this
service, as representing witches or the Devil. They also had imps
under their control. These imps were generally supposed to bear the
resemblance of some small insect,&#8212;such as a fly or a spider. The
latter animal was prevailingly considered as most likely to act in
this character. The accused person was closely watched, in order that
the spider imp might be seen when it approached to obtain its
nourishment, as it was thought to do, from the witchmark on the body
of the culprit. Within the cells of a prison, spiders were, of course,
often seen. Whenever one made its appearance, the guard attacked it
with all the zeal and vehemence with which it was natural and proper
to assault an agent of the Wicked One. If the spider was killed in the
encounter, it was considered as an innocent animal, and all suspicion
was removed from its character as the diabolical confederate of the
prisoner; but if it escaped into a crack or crevice of the apartment,
as spiders often do when assailed, all doubt of its guilty connection
with the person accused of witchcraft was removed: it was set down as,
beyond question or cavil, her veritable imp; and the evidence of her
confederacy with Satan was thenceforward regarded as complete. The
books of law and other learned writings, as well as the practice of
courts in the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[i.407]</a></span> countries, recognized this doctrine of
transformation into the shapes of animals, and the employment of imps.
Where judicial tribunals countenanced the popular credulity in
maintaining these ideas, there was no security for innocence, and no
escape from wrong. No matter how clear and certain the evidence
adduced, that an accused individual, at the time alleged, was absent
from the specified place; no matter how far distant, whether twenty or
a thousand miles, it availed him nothing; for it was charged that he
was present, and acted through his agent or imp. This notion was
further enlarged by the establishment of the additional doctrine, that
a witch could be present, and act with demoniac power upon her
victims, anywhere, at all times, and at any distance, without the
instrumental agency of any other animal or being, in her spirit,
spectre, or apparition. When the person on trial was accused of having
tortured or strangled or pinched or bruised another, it did not break
the force of the accusation to bring hundreds of witnesses to prove
that he was, at the very time, in another remote place or country; for
it was alleged that he was present in the spectral shape in which
Satan enabled his spirit to be and to act any and every where at once.
It was impossible to disprove the charge, and the last defence of
innocence was swept away.</p>

<p>If any thing strange or remarkable could be discovered in the persons,
histories, or deportment of accused persons, the usage of the
tribunals, and the books of authority on the subject, allowed it to be
brought in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[i.408]</a></span> evidence against them. If any thing they had forewarned,
or even conjectured, happened to come to pass, any careless speech had
been verified by events, any extraordinary knowledge had been
manifested, or any marvellous feats of strength or agility been
displayed, they were brought up with decisive and fatal effect.</p>

<p>A witch was believed to have the power of operating upon her victims,
at any distance, by the instrumentality of puppets. She would procure
or make an object like a doll, or a figure of some animal,&#8212;any little
bunch of cloth or bundle of rags would answer the purpose. She would
will the puppet to represent the person whom she proposed to torment
or afflict; and then whatever she did to the puppet would be suffered
by the party it represented at any distance, however remote. A pin
stuck into the puppet would pierce the flesh of the person whom she
wished to afflict, and produce the appropriate sensations of pain. So
would a pinch, or a blow, or any kind of violence. When any one was
arrested on the charge of witchcraft, a search was immediately made
for puppets from garret to cellar; and if any thing could be found
that might possibly be imagined to possess that character,&#8212;any
remnant of flannel or linen wrapped up, the foot of an old stocking,
or a cushion of any kind, particularly if there were any pins in
it,&#8212;it was considered as weighty and quite decisive evidence against
the accused party.</p>

<p>A writer, in a recent number of the &quot;North-Ameri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[i.409]</a></span>can Review,&quot; on the
superstitions of the American Indians, makes the following
statement:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;The sorcerer, by charms, magic songs, magic feats, and the
beating of his drum, had power over the spirits, and those
occult influences inherent in animals and inanimate things.
He could call to him the souls of his enemies. They appeared
before him in the form of stones. He chopped and bruised
them with his hatchet; blood and flesh issued forth; and the
intended victim, however distant, languished and died. Like
the sorcerer of the middle ages, he made images of those he
wished to destroy, and, muttering incantations, punctured
them with an awl; whereupon the persons represented sickened
and pined away.&quot;</p></div>

<p>It was a received opinion, accredited and acted upon in courts, that a
person in confederacy with the Evil One could not weep. Those accused
of this crime, both in Europe and America, were, in many instances, of
an age and condition which rendered it impossible for them, however
innocent, to escape the effect of this test. A decrepit, emaciated
person, shrivelled and desiccated by age, was placed at the bar: and
if she could not weep on the spot; if, in consequence of her withered
frame, her amazement and indignation at the false and malignant
charges by which she was circumvented, her exhausted sensibility, her
sullen despair, the hopeless horror of her situation, or, from what
often was found to be the effect of the treatment such persons
received, a high-toned consciousness of innocence, and a brave
defiance and stern condemnation of her maligners and persecutors; if,
from any cause,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[i.410]</a></span> the fountain of tears was closed or dried up,&#8212;their
failure to come forth at the bidding of her defamers was regarded as a
sure and irrefragable proof of her guilt.</p>

<p>King James explains the circumstance, that witches could not weep, in
rather a curious manner:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;For as, in a secret murther, if the dead carkasse bee at
any time thereafter handled by the murtherer it will gush
out of bloud, as if the bloud were crying to the heaven for
revenge of the murtherer, God having appointed that secret
supernaturall signe for triall of that secret unnaturall
crime; so it appeares that God hath appointed (for a
supernaturall signe of the monstrous impietie of witches),
that the water shall refuse to receive them in her bosome
that have shaken off them the sacred water of baptisme, and
wilfully refused the benefite thereof: no, not so much as
their eyes are able to shed teares (threaten and torture
them as ye please), while first they repent (God not
permitting them to dissemble their obstinacie in so horrible
a crime), albeit the woman kind especially be able otherwise
to shed teares at every light occasion when they will,&#8212;yea,
although it were dissemblingly like the crocodiles.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Reginald Scott, in introducing a Romish form of adjuration, makes the
following excellent remarks on the trial by tears:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;But alas that teares should be thought sufficient to excuse
or condemn in so great a cause, and so weightie a triall! I
am sure that the worst sort of the children of Israel wept
bitterlie; yea, if there were any witches at all in Israel,
they wept. For it is written, that all the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[i.411]</a></span> of
Israel wept. Finallie, if there be any witches in hell, I am
sure they weepe; for there is weeping and wailing and
gnashing of teeth. But God knoweth many an honest matron
cannot sometimes in the heaviness of her heart shed teares;
the which oftentimes are more readie and common with crafty
queans and strumpets than with sober women. For we read of
two kinds of teares in a woman's eie; the one of true
greefe, and the other of deceipt. And it is written, that
'Dediscere flere foeminam est mendacium;' which argueth that
they lie, which saie that wicked women cannot weepe. But let
these tormentors take heed, that the teares in this case
which runne down the widowe's cheeks, with their crie,
spoken of by Jesus Sirach, be not heard above. But, lo, what
learned, godlie and lawful meanes these Popish Inquisitors
have invented for the triall of true or false teares:&#8212;</p>

<p>'I conjure thee, by the amorous tears which Jesus Christ,
our Saviour, shed upon the crosse for the salvation of the
world; and by the most earnest and burning teares of his
mother, the most glorious Virgine Marie, sprinkled upon his
wounds late in the evening; and by all the teares which
everie saint and elect vessell of God hath poured out heere
in the world, and from whose eies he hath wiped awaie all
teares,&#8212;that, if thou be without fault, thou maist poure
downe teares aboundantlie; and, if thou be guiltie, that
thou weep in no wise. In the name of the Father, of the
Sonne, and of the Holie Ghost. Amen.'</p>

<p>&quot;The more you conjure, the lesse she weepeth.&quot;</p></div>

<p>A distinction was made between black and white witches. The former
were those who had leagued with Satan for the purpose of doing injury
to others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[i.412]</a></span> while the latter class was composed of such persons as had
resorted to the arts and charms of divination and sorcery in order to
protect themselves and others from diabolical influence. They were
both considered as highly, if not equally, criminal. Fuller, in his
&quot;Profane State,&quot; thus speaks of them: &quot;Better is it to lap one's
pottage like a dog, than to eat it mannerly, with a spoon of the
Devil's giving. Black witches hurt and do mischief; but, in deeds of
darkness, there is no difference of colors. The white and the black
are both guilty alike in compounding with the Devil.&quot; White witches
pretended to extract their power from the mysterious virtues of
certain plants. The following form of charmed words was used in
plucking them:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Hail to thee, holy herb,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Growing in the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the Mount of Calvarie,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">First wert thou found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art good for many a grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And healest many a wound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the name of sweet Jesu,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I lift thee from the ground.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then there was the evidence of ocular fascination. The accused and the
accusers were brought into the presence of the examining magistrate,
and the supposed witch was ordered to look upon the afflicted persons;
instantly upon coming within the glance of her eye, they would scream
out, and fall down as in a fit. It was thought that an invisible and
impalpable fluid darted from the eye of the witch, and penetrated the
brain of the bewitched. By bringing the witch so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[i.413]</a></span> near that she could
touch the afflicted persons with her hand, the malignant fluid was
attracted back into her hand, and the sufferers recovered their
senses. It is singular to notice the curious resemblance between this
opinion&#8212;the joint product of superstition and imposture&#8212;and the
results to which modern science has led us in the discoveries of
galvanism and animal electricity. The doctrine of fascination
maintained its hold upon the public credulity for a long time, and
gave occasion to the phrase, still in familiar use among us, of
&quot;looking upon a person with an evil eye.&quot; Its advocates claimed, in
its defence, the authority of the Cartesian philosophy; but it cannot
be considered, in an age of science and reason, as having any better
support than the rural superstition of Virgil's simple shepherd, who
thus complains of the condition of his emaciated flock:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&quot;They look so thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bones are barely covered with their skin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What magic has bewitched the woolly dams?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what ill eyes beheld the tender lambs?&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Witchcraft, in all ages and countries, was recognized as a reality,
just as much as any of the facts of nature, or incidents to which
mankind is liable. By the laws of all nations, Catholic and Protestant
alike, in the old country and in the new, it was treated as a capital
offence, and classed with murder and other highest crimes, although
regarded as of a deeper dye and blacker character than them all.
Indictments and trials of persons accused of it were not, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[i.414]</a></span>
considered as of any special interest, or as differing in any
essential particulars from proceedings against any other description
of offenders. There had been many such proceedings in the American
colonies,&#8212;more, perhaps, than have come to our knowledge,&#8212;previous
to 1692. They were not looked upon as sufficiently extraordinary to be
transferred, from the oblivion sweeping like a perpetual deluge over
the vast multitude of human experiences, to the ark of history, which
rescues only a select few. The following are the principal facts of
this class of which we have information:&#8212;</p>

<p>William Penn presided, in his judicial character, at the trial of two
Swedish women for witchcraft; the grand jury, acting under
instructions from him, having found bills against them. They were
saved, not in consequence of any peculiar reluctance to proceed
against them arising out of the nature of the alleged crime, but only
from some technical defect in the indictment. If it had not been for
this accidental circumstance, as the annalist of Philadelphia
suggests, scenes similar to those subsequently occurring in Salem
Village might have darkened the history of the Quakers, Swedes,
Germans, and Dutch, who dwelt in the City of Brotherly Love and the
adjacent colonies. There had been trials and executions for witchcraft
in other parts of New England, and excitements had obtained more or
less currency in reference to the assaults of the powers of darkness
upon human affairs. These incidents prepared the way for the delusion
in Salem, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[i.415]</a></span> provided elements to form its character. They must not,
therefore, be wholly overlooked. But the memorials for their
elucidation are very defective. Hutchinson's &quot;History of
Massachusetts&quot; is, perhaps, the most valuable authority on the
subject. He enjoyed an advantage over any other writer, before, since,
or hereafter, so far as relates to the witchcraft proceedings in 1692;
for he had access to all the records and documents connected with it,
a great part of which have subsequently been lost or destroyed. His
treatment of that particular topic is more satisfactory than can
elsewhere be found. But of incidents of the sort that preceded it, his
information appears to have been very slight and unreliable. It is a
singular fact, that we know more of the history of the first century
of New England than was known by the most enlightened persons of the
intermediate century. There was no regular organized newspaper press,
the commemorative age had not begun, and none seem to have been fully
aware of the importance of putting events on record. The publication,
but a few years since, of the colonial journals of the first
half-century of Massachusetts; researches by innumerable hands among
papers on file in public offices; the printing of town-histories, and
the collections made by historical and genealogical societies,&#8212;have
rescued from oblivion, and redeemed from error, many points of the
greatest interest and importance.</p>

<p>Winthrop, in his &quot;Journal,&quot; gives an account of the execution of
Margaret Jones, of Charlestown, who had been tried and condemned by
the Court of Assistants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[i.416]</a></span> The charges against her were, that she had a
malignant touch, so that many persons,&#8212;&quot;men, women, and
children,&quot;&#8212;on coming in contact with her, were &quot;taken with deafness,
vomiting, or other violent pains or sickness;&quot; that she practised
physic, and her medicines, &quot;being such things as (by her own
confession) were harmless, as aniseed, liquors, &amp;c., yet had
extraordinary violent effects;&quot; and that they found on her body, &quot;upon
a forced search,&quot; the witchmarks, particularly &quot;a teat, as fresh if it
had been newly sucked.&quot; Other ridiculous allegations were made against
her. As for the effects of the touch, it is obvious that they could be
easily simulated by evil-disposed persons. The whole substance of her
offence seems to have been, that she was very successful in the use of
simple prescriptions for the cure of diseases. Her practice was
charged as &quot;against the ordinary course, and beyond the apprehension
of all physicians and surgeons.&quot; A bitter animosity was, accordingly,
raised against her. She treated her accusers and defamers with
indignant resentment. &quot;Her behavior at her trial,&quot; says Winthrop, &quot;was
very intemperate, lying notoriously, and railing upon the jury and
witnesses, &amp;c.; and, in the like distemper, she died.&quot; We shall find
that the bold assertion of innocence, and indignant denunciations of
the persecutors and defamers who had destroyed their reputations and
pursued them to the death, by persons tried and executed for
witchcraft, in 1692, were regarded by some, as they were by Winthrop,
as proofs of ill-temper and falsehood. The Governor closes his
statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[i.417]</a></span> about Margaret Jones, by relating what he regarded as a
demonstration of her guilt: &quot;The same day and hour she was executed,
there was a very great tempest at Connecticut, which blew down many
trees, &amp;c.&quot; The records of the General Court contain no express notice
of this case. Perhaps it is referred to in the following paragraph,
under date of May 13, 1648:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;This Court, being desirous that the same course which hath
been taken in England for the discovery of witches, by
watching, may also be taken here, with the witch now in
question, and therefore do order that a strict watch be set
about her every night, and that her husband be confined to a
private room, and watched also.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Margaret Jones was executed in Boston on the 15th of June. Hutchinson
refers to the statement made by Johnson, in the &quot;Wonder-working
Providence,&quot; that &quot;more than one or two in Springfield, in 1645, were
suspected of witchcraft; that much diligence was used, both for the
finding them and for the Lord's assisting them against their witchery;
yet have they, as is supposed, bewitched not a few persons, among whom
two of the reverend elder's children.&quot; Johnson's loose and
immethodical narrative covers the period from 1645 till toward the end
of 1651; and Hutchinson was probably misled in supposing that the
Springfield cases occurred as early as 1645. The Massachusetts
colonial records, under the date of May 8, 1651, have this entry:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[i.418]</a></span>&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;The Court, understanding that Mary Parsons, now in prison,
accused for a witch, is likely, through weakness, to die
before trial, if it be deferred, do order, that, on the
morrow, by eight o'clock in the morning, she be brought
before and tried by the General Court, the rather that Mr.
Pinchon may be present to give his testimony in the case.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Mr. Pinchon was probably able to stay a few days longer. She was not
brought to trial before the Court until the 13th, under which date is
the following:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Mary Parsons, wife of Hugh Parsons, of Springfield, being
committed to prison for suspicion of witchcraft, as also for
murdering her own child, was this day called forth, and
indicted for witchcraft. 'By the name of Mary Parsons, you
are here, before the General Court, charged, in the name of
this Commonwealth, that, not having the fear of God before
your eyes nor in your heart, being seduced by the Devil, and
yielding to his malicious motion, about the end of February
last, at Springfield, to have familiarity, or consulted
with, a familiar spirit, making a covenant with him; and
have used divers devilish practices by witchcraft, to the
hurt of the persons of Martha and Rebecca Moxon, against the
word of God and the laws of this jurisdiction, long since
made and published.' To which indictment she pleaded 'Not
guilty.' All evidences brought in against her being heard
and examined, the Court found the evidences were not
sufficient to prove her a witch, and therefore she was
cleared in that respect.</p>

<p>&quot;At the same time, she was indicted for murdering her child.
'By the name of Mary Parsons, you are here, before the
General Court, charged, in the name of this Common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[i.419]</a></span>wealth,
that, not having the fear of God before your eyes nor in
your heart, being seduced by the Devil, and yielding to his
instigations and the wickedness of your own heart, about the
beginning of March last, in Springfield, in or near your own
house, did wilfully and most wickedly murder your own child,
against the word of God and the laws of this jurisdiction,
long since made and published.' To which she acknowledged
herself guilty.</p>

<p>&quot;The Court, finding her guilty of murder by her own
confession, &amp;c., proceeded to judgment: 'You shall be
carried from this place to the place from whence you came,
and from thence to the place of execution, and there hang
till you be dead.'&quot;</p></div>

<p>Under the same date&#8212;May 13&#8212;is an order of the Court appointing a day
of humiliation &quot;throughout our jurisdiction in all the churches,&quot; in
consideration, among other things, of the extent to which &quot;Satan
prevails amongst us in respect of witchcrafts.&quot;</p>

<p>The colonial records, under date of May 31, 1652, recite the facts,
that Hugh Parsons, of Springfield, had been tried before the Court of
Assistants&#8212;held at Boston, May 12, 1652&#8212;for witchcraft; that the
case was transferred to a &quot;jury of trials,&quot; which found him guilty.
The magistrates not consenting to the verdict of the jury, the case
came legally to the General Court, which body decided that &quot;he was not
legally guilty of witchcraft, and so not to die by law.&quot;</p>

<p>When these citations are collated and examined, and it is remembered
that Mr. Moxon was the &quot;reverend elder&quot; of the church at Springfield,
it cannot be doubted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[i.420]</a></span> that the case of the Parsonses is that referred
to by Johnson in the &quot;Wonder-working Providence,&quot; and that Hutchinson
was in error as to the date. We are left in doubt as to the fate of
Mary Parsons. There is a marginal entry on the records, to the effect
that she was reprieved to the 29th of May. Neither Johnson nor
Hutchinson seem to have thought that the sentence was ever carried
into effect. It clearly never ought to have been. The woman was in a
weak and dying condition, her mind was probably broken down,&#8212;the
victim of that peculiar kind of mania&#8212;partaking of the character of a
religious fanaticism and perversion of ideas&#8212;that has often led to
child-murder.</p>

<p>These instances show, that, at that time, the General Court exercised
consideration and discrimination in the treatment of questions of this
kind brought before it.</p>

<p>Hutchinson, on the authority of Hale, says that a woman at Dorchester,
and another at Cambridge, were executed, not far from this time, for
witchcraft; and that they asserted their innocence with their dying
breath. He also says, that, in 1650, &quot;a poor wretch,&#8212;Mary
Oliver,&#8212;probably weary of her life from the general reputation of
being a witch, after long examination, was brought to a confession of
her guilt; but I do not find that she was executed.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1656, a very remarkable case occurred. William Hibbins was a
merchant in Boston, and one of the most prominent and honored citizens
of Massachusetts. He was admitted a freeman in 1640; was deputy in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[i.421]</a></span> General Court in that and the following year; was elected an
assistant for twelve successive years,&#8212;from 1643 to 1654; represented
the Colony, for a time, as its agent in England, and received the
thanks of the General Court for his valuable service there. No one
appears to have had more influence, or to have enjoyed more honorable
distinction, during his long legislative career. He died in 1654.
Hutchinson says, in the text of his first and second volumes, that his
widow was tried, condemned, and hanged as a witch in 1655, although he
corrects the error in a note to the passage in the first volume. The
following is the statement of the case in the Massachusetts colonial
records, under the date of May 14, 1656:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;The magistrates not receiving the verdict of the jury in
Mrs. Hibbins her case, having been on trial for witchcraft,
it came and fell, of course, to the General Court. Mrs. Ann
Hibbins was called forth, appeared at the bar, the
indictment against her was read; to which she answered, 'Not
guilty,' and was willing to be tried by God and this Court.
The evidence against her was read, the parties witnessing
being present, her answers considered on; and the whole
Court, being met together, by their vote, determined that
Mrs. Ann Hibbins is guilty of witchcraft, according to the
bill of indictment found against her by the jury of life and
death. The Governor, in open Court, pronounced sentence
accordingly; declaring she was to go from the bar to the
place from whence she came, and from thence to the place of
execution, and there to hang till she was dead.</p>

<p>&quot;It is ordered, that warrant shall issue out from the
secretary to the marshal general, for the execution of Mrs.
Hib<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[i.422]</a></span>bins, on the fifth day next come fortnight, presently
after the lecture at Boston, being the 19th of June next;
the marshal general taking with him a sufficient guard.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Hibbins is stated to have been a sister of Richard Bellingham, at
that very time deputy-governor, and always regarded as one of the
chief men in the country. Strange to say, very little notice appears
to have been taken of this event, beyond the immediate locality; but
what little has come down to us indicates that it was a case of
outrageous folly and barbarity, justly reflecting infamy upon the
community at the time. Hutchinson, who wrote a hundred years after the
event, and evidently had no other foundation for his opinion than
vague conjectural tradition, gives the following explanation of the
proceedings against her: &quot;Losses, in the latter part of her husband's
life, had reduced his estate, and increased the natural crabbedness of
his wife's temper, which made her turbulent and quarrelsome, and
brought her under church censures, and at length rendered her so
odious to her neighbors as to cause some of them to accuse her of
witchcraft.&quot;</p>

<p>While this is hardly worthy of being considered a sufficient
explanation of the matter,&#8212;it being beyond belief, that, even at that
time, a person could be condemned and executed merely on account of a
&quot;crabbed temper,&quot;&#8212;it is not consistent with the facts, as made known
to us from the record-offices. She could not have been so reduced in
circumstances as to produce such extraordinary effects upon her
character, for she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[i.423]</a></span> left a good estate. The truth is, that the tongue
of slander was let loose upon her, and the calumnies circulated by
reckless gossip became so magnified and exaggerated, and assumed such
proportions, as enabled her vilifiers to bring her under the censure
of the church, and that emboldened them to cry out against her as a
witch. Hutchinson expresses the opinion that she was the victim of
popular clamor. But that alone, without some pretence or show of
evidence, could not have brought the General Court, in reversal of the
judgment of the magistrates, to condemn to death a person of such a
high social position.</p>

<p>The only clue we have to the kind of evidence bearing upon the charge
of witchcraft that brought this recently bereaved widow to so cruel
and shameful a death, is in a letter, written by a clergyman in
Jamaica to Increase Mather in 1684, in which he says, &quot;You may
remember what I have sometimes told you your famous Mr. Norton once
said at his own table,&#8212;before Mr. Wilson, the pastor, elder Penn, and
myself and wife, &amp;c., who had the honor to be his guests,&#8212;that one of
your magistrate's wives, as I remember, was hanged for a witch only
for having more wit than her neighbors. It was his very expression;
she having, as he explained it, unhappily guessed that two of her
persecutors, whom she saw talking in the street, were talking of her,
which, proving true, cost her her life, notwithstanding all he could
do to the contrary, as he himself told us.&quot; Nothing was more natural
than for her to suppose, knowing the parties, witnessing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[i.424]</a></span>
manner, considering their active co-operation in getting up the
excitement against her, which was then the all-engrossing topic, that
they were talking about her. But, in the blind infatuation of the
time, it was considered proof positive of her being possessed, by the
aid of the Devil, of supernatural insight,&#8212;precisely as, forty years
afterwards, such evidence was brought to bear, with telling effect,
against George Burroughs.&#8212;The body of this unfortunate lady was
searched for witchmarks, and her trunks and premises rummaged for
puppets.</p>

<p>It is quite evident that means were used to get up a violent popular
excitement against her, which became so formidable as to silence every
voice that dared to speak in her favor. Joshua Scottow, a citizen of
great respectability and a selectman, ventured to give evidence in her
favor, counter, in its bearings, to some testimony against her; and he
was dealt with very severely, and compelled to write an humble apology
to the Court, to disavow all friendly interest in Mrs. Hibbins, and to
pray &quot;that the sword of justice may be drawn forth against all
wickedness.&quot; He says, &quot;I am cordially sorry that any thing from me,
either by word or writing, should give offence to the honored Court,
my dear brethren in the church, or any others.&quot;</p>

<p>Hutchinson states that there were, however, some persons then in
Boston, who denounced the proceedings against Mrs. Hibbins, and
regarded her, not merely as a persecuted woman, but as &quot;a saint;&quot; that
a deep feeling of resentment against her persecutors long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[i.425]</a></span> remained in
their minds; and that they afterwards &quot;observed solemn marks of
Providence set upon those who were very forward to condemn her.&quot; It is
evident that the Court of Magistrates were opposed to her conviction,
and that Mr. Norton did what he could to save her. He was one of the
four &quot;great Johns,&quot; who were the first ministers of the church in
Boston; and it is remarkable, as showing the violence of the people
against her, that even his influence was of no avail in her favor. But
she had other friends, as appears from her will, which, after all, is
the only source of reliable information we have respecting her
character. It is dated May 27, 1656, a few days after she received the
sentence of death. In it she names, as overseers and administrators of
her estate, &quot;Captain Thomas Clarke, Lieutenant Edward Hutchinson,
Lieutenant William Hudson, Ensign Joshua Scottow, and Cornet Peter
Oliver.&quot; In a codicil, she says, &quot;I do earnestly desire my loving
friends, Captain Johnson and Mr. Edward Rawson, to be added to the
rest of the gentlemen mentioned as overseers of my will.&quot; It can
hardly be doubted, that these persons&#8212;and they were all leading
citizens&#8212;were known by her to be among her friends.</p>

<p>The whole tone and manner of these instruments give evidence, that she
had a mind capable of rising above the power of wrong, suffering, and
death itself. They show a spirit calm and serene. The disposition of
her property indicates good sense, good feeling, and business
faculties suitable to the occasion. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[i.426]</a></span> body of the will, there is
not a word, a syllable, or a turn of expression, that refers to, or is
in the slightest degree colored by, her peculiar situation. In the
codicil, dated June 16, there is this sentence: &quot;My desire is, that
all my overseers would be pleased to show so much respect unto my dead
corpse as to cause it to be decently interred, and, if it may be, near
my late husband.&quot;</p>

<p>When married to Mr. Hibbins, she was a widow, named Moore. There were
no children by her last marriage,&#8212;certainly none living at the time
of her death. There were three sons by her former marriage,&#8212;John,
Joseph, and Jonathan. These were all in England; but the youngest,
hearing of her situation, embarked for America. When she wrote the
codicil,&#8212;three days before her execution,&#8212;she added, at the end,
having apparently just heard of his coming, &quot;I give my son Jonathan
twenty pounds, over and above what I have already given him, towards
his pains and charge in coming to see me, which shall be first paid
out of my estate.&quot; There is reason to cherish the belief that he
reached her in the short interval between the date of the codicil and
her death, from the tenor of the following postscript, written and
signed on the morning of her execution: &quot;My further mind and will is,
out of my sense of the more than ordinary affection and pains of my
son Jonathan in the times of my distress, I give him, as a further
legacy, ten pounds.&quot; The will was proved in Court, July 2, 1656. The
will and codicil speak of her &quot;farms at Muddy River;&quot; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[i.427]</a></span> of chests
and a desk, in which were valuables of such importance that she took
especial pains to intrust the keys of them to Edward Rawson, in a
provision of the codicil. The estate was inventoried at &#163;344. 14<i>s.</i>,
which was a considerable property in those days, as money was then
valued.</p>

<p>Hutchinson mentions a case of witchcraft in Hartford, in 1662, where
some women were accused, and, after being proceeded against until they
were confounded and bewildered, one of them made the most preposterous
confessions, which ought to have satisfied every one that her reason
was overthrown; three of them were condemned, and one,
certainly,&#8212;probably all,&#8212;executed. In 1669, he says that Susanna
Martin, of Salisbury,&#8212;whom we shall meet again,&#8212;was bound over to
the Court on the same charge, &quot;but escaped at that time.&quot; Another case
is mentioned by him as having occurred, in 1671, at Groton, in which
the party confessed, and thereby avoided condemnation. In 1673, a case
occurred at Hampton; but the jury, although, as they said, there was
strong ground of suspicion, returned a verdict of &quot;Not guilty;&quot; the
evidence not being deemed quite sufficient. There were several other
cases, about this time, in which some persons were severely handled in
consequence of being reputed witches; and others suffered, as they
imagined, &quot;under an evil hand.&quot;</p>

<p>In this immediate neighborhood, there had been several attempts,
previous to the delusion at Salem Village in 1692, to get up
witchcraft prosecutions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[i.428]</a></span> but without much success. The people of this
county had not become sufficiently infected with the fanaticism of the
times to proceed to extremities.</p>

<p>In September, 1652, the following presentment was made by the grand
jury:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;We present John Bradstreet, of Rowley, for suspicion of
having familiarity with the Devil. He said he read in a book
of magic, and that he heard a voice asking him what work he
had for him. He answered, 'Go make a bridge of sand over the
sea; go make a ladder of sand up to heaven, and go to God,
and come down no more.'</p>
<p style="text-align: right">
&quot;Witness hereof, <span class="smcap">Francis Parat</span> and his wife, of Rowley.<br />
&quot;Witness, <span class="smcap">William Bartholomew</span>, of Ipswich.&quot;<br />
</p>
</div>


<p>On the 28th of that month, the jury at Ipswich, &quot;upon examination of
the case, found he had told a lie, which was a second, being convicted
once before. The Court sets a fine of twenty shillings, or else to be
whipped.&quot;</p>

<p>Bradstreet was probably in the habit of romancing, and it was wisely
concluded not to take a more serious view of his offences.</p>

<p>In 1658, a singular case of this kind occurred in Essex County. The
following papers relating to it illustrate the sentiments and forms of
thought prevalent at that time, and give an insight of the state of
society in some particulars:&#8212;</p>

<p>The petitioners mention in brief some instances in confirmation of
their complaint. There are several depositions. That of Charles Browne
and wife says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;About six or seven years since, in the meeting-house of
Rowley, being in the gallery in the first seat, there was
one in the second seat which he doth, to his best
remembrance, think and believe it was John Godfrey. This
deponent did see him, yawning, open his mouth; and, while he
so yawned, this deponent did see a small teat under his
tongue. And, further, this deponent saith that John Godfrey
was in this deponent's house about three years since.
Speaking about the power of witches, he the said Godfrey
spoke, that, if witches were not kindly entertained, the
Devil will appear unto them, and ask them if they were
grieved or vexed with anybody, and ask them what he should
do for them; and, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[i.430]</a></span> they would not give them beer or
victuals, they might let all the beer run out of the cellar;
and, if they looked steadfastly upon any creature, it would
die; and, if it were hard to some witches to take away life,
either of man or beast, yet, when they once begin it, then
it is easy to them.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The depositions in this case are presented as they are in the
originals on file, leaving in blank such words or parts of words as
have been worn off. They are given in full.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;<span class="smcap">The Deposition of Isabel Holdred</span>, who testifieth
that John Godfree came to the house of Henry Blazdall, where
her husband and herself were, and demanded a debt of her
husband, and said a warrant was out, and Goodman Lord was
suddenly to come. John Godfree asked if we would not pay
him. The deponent answered, 'Yes, to-night or to-morrow, if
we had it; for I believe we shall not ... we are in thy
debt.' John Godfree answered, 'That is a bitter word;' ...
said, 'I must begin, and must send Goodman Lord.' The
deponent answered, '... when thou wilt. I fear thee not, nor
all the devils in hell!' And, further, this deponent
testifieth, that, two days after this, she was taken with
those strange fits, with which she was tormented a fortnight
together, night and day. And several apparitions appeared to
the deponent in the night. The first night, a humble-bee,
the next night a bear, appeared, which grinned the teeth and
shook the claw: 'Thou sayest thou art not afraid. Thou
thinkest Harry Blazdall's house will save thee.' The
deponent answered, 'I hope the Lord Jesus Christ will save
me.' The apparition then spake: 'Thou sayst thou art not
afraid of all the devils in hell; but I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[i.431]</a></span> have thy
heart's blood within a few hours!' The next was the
apparition of a great snake, at which the deponent was
exceedingly affrighted, and skipt to Nathan Gold, who was in
the opposite chimney-corner, and caught hold of the hair of
his head; and her speech was taken away for the space of
half an hour. The next night appeared a great horse; and,
Thomas Hayne being there, the deponent told him of it, and
showed him where. The said Tho. Hayne took a stick, and
struck at the place where the apparition was; and his stroke
glanced by the side of it, and it went under the table. And
he went to strike again; then the apparition fled to the ...
and made it shake, and went away. And, about a week after,
the deponent ... son were at the door of Nathan Gold, and
heard a rushing on the ... The deponent said to her son,
'Yonder is a beast.' He answered, ''Tis one of Goodman
Cobbye's black oxen;' and it came toward them, and came
within ... yards of them. The deponent her heart began to
ache, for it seemed to have great eyes; and spoke to the
boy, 'Let's go in.' But suddenly the ox beat her up against
the wall, and struck her down; and she was much hurt by it,
not being able to rise up. But some others carried me into
the house, all my face being bloody, being much bruised. The
boy was much affrighted a long time after; and, for the
space of two hours, he was in a sweat that one might have
washed hands on his hair. Further this deponent affirmeth,
that she hath been often troubled with ... black cat
sometimes appearing in the house, and sometimes in the night
... bed, and lay on her, and sometimes stroking her face.
The cat seemed ... thrice as big as an ordinary cat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Thomas Hayne</span> testifieth, that, being with Goodwife
Holdridge, she told me that she saw a great horse, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[i.432]</a></span>
showed me where it stood. I then took a stick, and struck on
the place, but felt nothing; and I heard the door shake, and
Good. H. said it was gone out at the door. Immediately
after, she was taken with extremity of fear and pain, so
that she presently fell into a sweat, and I thought she
would swoon. She trembled and shook like a leaf.</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Nathan Gould</span> being with Goodwife Holgreg one

could not speak for the space of half an hour.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Nathan Gould</span>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">William Osgood</span> testifieth, that, in the yeare '40,
in the month of August,&#8212;he being then building a barn for
Mr. Spencer,&#8212;John Godfree being then Mr. Spencer's
herdsman, he on an evening came to the frame, where divers
men were at work, and said that he had gotten a new master
against the time he had done keeping cows. The said William
Osgood asked him who it was. He answered, he knew not. He
again asked him where he dwelt. He answered, he knew not. He
asked him what his name was. He answered, he knew not. He
then said to him, 'How, then, wilt thou go to him when thy
time is out?' He said, 'The man will come and fetch me
then.' I asked him, 'Hast thou made an absolute bargain?' He
answered that a covenant was made, and he had set his hand
to it. He then asked of him whether he had not a counter
covenant. Godfree answered, 'No.' W.O. said, 'What a mad
fellow art thou to make a covenant in this manner!' He said,
'He's an honest man.'&#8212;'How knowest thou?' said W.O. J.
Godfree answered. 'He looks like one.' W.O. then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[i.433]</a></span> answered,
'I am persuaded thou hast made a covenant with the Devil.'
He then skipped about, and said, 'I profess, I profess!'</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">William Osgood</span>.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The proceedings against Godfrey were carried up to other tribunals, as
appears by a record of the County Court at Salem, 28th of June,
1659:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;John Godfrey stands bound in one hundred pound bond to the
treasurer of this county for his appearance at a General
Court, or Court of Assistants, when he shall be legally
summonsed thereunto.&quot;</p></div>

<p>What action, if any, was had by either of these high courts, I have
found no information. But he must have come off unscathed; for, soon
after, he commenced actions in the County Court for defamation against
his accusers; with the following results:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;John Godfery plt. agst. Will. Simonds &amp; Sam.<sup>ll</sup> his son

&#163;2-16-0.&quot;</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[i.434]</a></span></p>

<p>In the trial of the case between Godfrey and Singletary, the latter
attempted to prove the truth of his allegations against the former, by
giving the following piece of testimony, which, while it failed to
convince the jury, is worth preserving, from the inherent interest of
some of its details:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Date the fourteenth the twelfth month, '62.&#8212;<span class="smcap">The
Deposition of Jonathan Singletary</span>, aged about 23, who
testifieth that I, being in the prison at Ipswich this night
last past between nine and ten of the clock at night, after
the bell had rung, I being set in a corner of the prison,
upon a sudden I heard a great noise as if many cats had been
climbing up the prison walls, and skipping into the house at
the windows, and jumping about the chamber; and a noise as
if boards' ends or stools had been thrown about, and men
walking in the chambers, and a crackling and shaking as if
the house would have fallen upon me. I seeing this, and
considering what I knew by a young man that kept at my house
last Indian Harvest, and, upon some difference with John
Godfre, he was presently several nights in a strange manner
troubled, and complaining as he did, and upon consideration
of this and other things that I knew by him, I was at
present something affrighted; yet considering what I had
lately heard made out by Mr. Mitchel at Cambridge, that
there is more good in God than there is evil in sin, and
that although God is the greatest good, and sin the greatest
evil, yet the first Being of evil cannot weane the scales or
overpower the first Being of good: so considering that the
author of good was of greater power than the author of evil,
God was pleased of his goodness to keep me from being out of
measure frighted. So this noise above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[i.435]</a></span>said held as I suppose
about a quarter of an hour, and then ceased: and presently I
heard the bolt of the door shoot or go back as perfectly, to
my thinking, as I did the next morning when the keeper came
to unlock it; and I could not see the door open, but I saw
John Godfre stand within the door and said, 'Jonathan,
Jonathan.' So I, looking on him, said, 'What have you to do
with me?' He said, 'I come to see you: are you weary of your
place yet?' I answered, 'I take no delight in being here,
but I will be out as soon as I can.' He said, 'If you will
pay me in corn, you shall come out.' I answered, 'No: if
that had been my intent, I would have paid the marshal, and
never have come hither.' He, knocking of his fist at me in a
kind of a threatening way, said he would make me weary of my
part, and so went away, I knew not how nor which way; and,
as I was walking about in the prison, I tripped upon a stone
with my heel, and took it up in my hand, thinking that if he
came again I would strike at him. So, as I was walking
about, he called at the window, 'Jonathan,' said he, 'if you
will pay me corn, I will give you two years day, and we will
come to an agreement;' I answered him saying, 'Why do you
come dissembling and playing the Devil's part here? Your
nature is nothing but envy and malice, which you will vent,
though to your own loss; and you seek peace with no
man.'&#8212;'I do not dissemble,' said he: 'I will give you my
hand upon it, I am in earnest.' So he put his hand in at the
window, and I took hold of it with my left hand, and pulled
him to me; and with the stone in my right hand I thought I
struck him, and went to recover my hand to strike again, and
his hand was gone, and I would have struck, but there was
nothing to strike: and how he went away I know not; for I
could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[i.436]</a></span> neither feel when his hand went out of mine, nor see
which way he went.&quot;</p></div>

<p>It can hardly be doubted, that Singletary's story was the result of
the workings of an excited imagination, in wild and frightful dreams
under the spasms of nightmare. We shall meet similar phenomena, when
we come to the testimony in the trials of 1692.</p>

<p>Godfrey was a most eccentric character. He courted and challenged the
imputation of witchcraft, and took delight in playing upon the
credulity of his neighbors, enjoying the exhibition of their
amazement, horror, and consternation. He was a person of much
notoriety, had more lawsuits, it is probable, than any other man in
the colony, and in one instance came under the criminal jurisdiction
for familiarity with other than immaterial spirits; for we find, by
the record of Sept. 25, 1666, that John Godfrey was &quot;fined for being
drunk.&quot;</p>

<p>I have allowed so much space to the foregoing documents, because they
show the fancies which, fermenting in the public mind, and inflamed by
the prevalent literature, theology, and philosophy, came to a head
thirty years afterwards; and because they prove that in 1660 a
conviction for witchcraft could not be obtained in this county. The
evidence against none of the convicts in 1692, throwing out of view
the statements and actings of the &quot;afflicted children,&quot; was half so
strong as that against Godfrey. Short work would have been made with
him then.</p>

<p>There is one particularly interesting item in Single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[i.437]</a></span>tary's
deposition. It illustrates the value of good preaching. This young
man, in his gloomy prison, and overwhelmed with the terrors of
superstition, found consolation, courage, and strength in what he
remembered of a sermon, to which he had happened to listen, from
&quot;Matchless Mitchel.&quot; It was indeed good doctrine; and it is to be
lamented that it was not carried out to its logical conclusions, and
constantly enforced by the divines of that and subsequent times.</p>

<p>In November, 1669, there was a prosecution of &quot;Goody Burt,&quot; a widow,
concerning whom the most marvellous stories were told. The principal
witness against her was Philip Reed, a physician, who on oath declared
his belief that &quot;no natural cause&quot; could produce such effects as were
wrought by Goody Burt upon persons whom she afflicted. Her range of
operations seems to have been confined to Marblehead, Lynn, Salem, and
the vicinity: as nothing more was ever heard of the case, another
evidence is afforded, that an Essex jury, notwithstanding this
positive opinion of a doctor, was not ready to convict on the charge
of witchcraft. This same Philip Reed tried very hard to prosecute
proceedings, eleven years afterwards, against Margaret Gifford as a
witch. But she failed to appear, and no effort is recorded as having
been made to apprehend her.</p>

<p>In 1673, Eunice Cole, of Hampton, was tried before a county court, at
Salisbury, on the charge of witchcraft; and she was committed to jail,
in Boston, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[i.438]</a></span> further proceedings. She was subsequently indicted by
the Grand Jury for the Massachusetts jurisdiction for &quot;familiarity
with the Devil.&quot; The Court of Assistants found that there was &quot;just
ground of vehement suspicion of her having had familiarity with the
Devil,&quot; and got rid of the case by ordering her &quot;to depart from and
abide out of this jurisdiction.&quot;</p>

<p>At a County Court, held at Salem, Nov. 24, 1674, a case was brought
up, of which the following is all we know:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Christopher Browne having reported that he had been
treating or discoursing with one whom he apprehended to be
the Devil, which came like a gentleman, in order to his
binding himself to be a servant to him, upon his
examination, his discourse seeming inconsistent with truth,
&amp;c., the Court, giving him good counsel and caution, for the
present dismiss him.&quot;</p></div>

<p>It would have been well if the action of this Court had been followed
as an authoritative precedent.</p>

<p>In the year 1679, the house of William Morse, of Newbury, was, for
more than two months, infested in a most strange and vexatious manner.
The affair was brought into court, where it played a conspicuous part,
and was near reaching a tragical conclusion. The history of the
proceedings in reference to it is very curious.</p>

<p>Mr. John Woodbridge, of Newbury, had been for some time an associate
county judge, and was commissioned to administer oaths and join
persons in marriage. The following is a record of what occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[i.439]</a></span>
before him, sitting as a magistrate, and as a commissioner to
adjudicate in small, local causes, and hold examinations in matters
that went to higher courts:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Dec. 3, 1679.&#8212;Caleb Powell, being complained of for
suspicion of working with the Devil to the molesting of
William Morse and his family, was by warrant directed to the
constable brought in by him. The accusation and testimonies
were read, and the complaint respited till the Monday
following.</p>

<p>&quot;Dec. 8, 1679.&#8212;Caleb Powell appeared according to order,
and further testimony produced against him by William Morse,
which being read and considered, it was determined that the
said William Morse should prosecute the case against said
Powell at the County Court to be held at Ipswich the last
Tuesday in March ensuing; and, in order hereunto, William
Morse acknowledgeth himself indebted to the Treasurer of the
County of Essex the full sum of twenty pounds. The condition
of this obligation is, that the said William Morse shall
prosecute his complaint against Caleb Powell at that Court.</p>

<p>&quot;Caleb Powell was delivered as a prisoner to the constable
till he could find security of twenty pounds for the
answering of the said complaint, or else he was to be
carried to prison.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Jo: Woodbridge</span>, <i>Commissioner</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Powell was accordingly brought before the Court at Ipswich, March 30,
1680, under an indictment for witchcraft. Before giving the substance
of the evidence adduced on this occasion, it will be well to mention
the manner in which he got into the case as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[i.440]</a></span> a principal. He was a
mate of a vessel. While at home, between voyages, he happened to hear
of the wonderful occurrences at Mr. Morse's house. His curiosity was
awakened, and he was also actuated by feelings of commiseration for
the family under the torments and terrors with which they were said to
be afflicted. Determined to see what it all meant, and to put a stop
to it if he could, he went to the house, and soon became satisfied
that a roguish grandchild was the cause of all the trouble. He
prevailed upon the old grandparents to let him take off the boy.
Immediately upon his removal, the difficulty ceased.</p>

<p>New-England navigators, at that time and long afterwards, sailed
almost wholly by the stars; and Powell probably had often related his
own skill, which, as mate of a vessel, he would have been likely to
acquire, in calculating his position, rate of sailing, and distances,
on the boundless and trackless ocean, by his knowledge and
observations of the heavenly bodies. He had said, perhaps, that, by
gazing among the stars, he could, at any hour of the night, however
long or far he had been tossed and driven on the ocean, tell exactly
where his vessel was. Hence the charge of being an astrologist.
Probably, like other sailors, Powell may have indulged in &quot;long yarns&quot;
to the country people, of the wonders he had seen, &quot;some in one
country, and some in another.&quot; It is not unlikely, that, in foreign
ports, he had witnessed exhibitions of necromancy and mesmerism,
which, in various forms and under different names,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[i.441]</a></span> have always been
practised. Possibly he may have boasted to be a medium himself, a
scholar and adept in the mystic art, able to read and divine &quot;the
workings of spirits.&quot; At any rate, when it became known, that, at a
glance, he attributed to the boy the cause of the mischief, and that
it ceased on his taking him away from the house, the opinion became
settled that he was a wizard. He was arrested forthwith, and brought
to trial, as has been stated, for witchcraft. His astronomy,
astrology, and spiritualism brought him in peril of his life.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;<span class="smcap">The Testimony of William Morse</span>: which saith,
together with his wife, aged both about sixty-five years:
that, Thursday night, being the twenty-seventh day of
November, we heard a great noise without, round the house,
of knocking the boards of the house, and, as we conceived,
throwing of stones against the house. Whereupon myself and
wife looked out and saw nobody, and the boy all this time
with us; but we had stones and sticks thrown at us, that we
were forced to retire into the house again. Afterwards we
went to bed, and the boy with us; and then the like noise
was upon the roof of the house.</p>

<p>&quot;2. The same night about midnight, the door being locked
when we went to bed, we heard a great hog in the house grunt
and make a noise, as we thought willing to get out; and,
that we might not be disturbed in our sleep, I rose to let
him out, and I found a hog in the house and the door
unlocked: the door was firmly locked when we went to bed.</p>

<p>&quot;3. The next morning, a stick of links hanging in the
chimney, they were thrown out of their place, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[i.442]</a></span> hanged
them up again, and they were thrown down again, and some
into the fire.</p>

<p>&quot;4. The night following, I had a great awl lying in the
window, the which awl we saw fall down out of the chimney
into the ashes by the fire.</p>

<p>&quot;5. After this, I bid the boy put the same awl into the
cupboard, which we saw done, and the door shut to: this same
awl came presently down the chimney again in our sight, and
I took it up myself. Again, the same night, we saw a little
Indian basket, that was in the loft before, come down the
chimney again. And I took the same basket, and put a piece
of brick into it, and the basket with the brick was gone,
and came down again the third time with the brick in it, and
went up again the fourth time, and came down again without
the brick; and the brick came down again a little after.</p>

<p>&quot;6. The next day, being Saturday, stones, sticks, and pieces
of bricks came down, so that we could not quietly dress our
breakfast; and sticks of fire also came down at the same
time.</p>

<p>&quot;7. That day in the afternoon, my thread four times taken
away, and came down the chimney; again, my awl and gimlet,
wanting, came down the chimney; again, my leather, taken
away, came down the chimney; again, my nails, being in the
cover of a firkin, taken away, came down the chimney. Again,
the same night, the door being locked, a little before day,
hearing a hog in the house, I rose, and saw the hog to be
mine: I let him out.</p>

<p>&quot;8. The next day being sabbath-day, many stones and sticks
and pieces of bricks came down the chimney: on the Monday,
Mr. Richardson and my brother being there, the frame of my
cowhouse they saw very firm. I sent my boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[i.443]</a></span> out to scare the
fowls from my hog's meat: he went to the cowhouse, and it
fell down, my boy crying with the hurt of the fall. In the
afternoon, the pots hanging over the fire did dash so
vehemently one against the other, we set down one that they
might not dash to pieces. I saw the andiron leap into the
pot, and dance and leap out, and again leap in and dance and
leap out again, and leap on a table and there abide, and my
wife saw the andiron on the table: also I saw the pot turn
itself over, and throw down all the water. Again, we saw a
tray with wool leap up and down, and throw the wool out, and
so many times, and saw nobody meddle with it. Again, a tub
his hoop fly off of itself and the tub turn over, and nobody
near it. Again, the woollen wheel turned upside down, and
stood up on its end, and a spade set on it; Steph.
Greenleafe saw it, and myself and my wife. Again, my
rope-tools fell down upon the ground before my boy could
take them, being sent for them; and the same thing of nails
tumbled down from the loft into the ground, and nobody near.
Again, my wife and boy making the bed, the chest did open
and shut: the bed-clothes could not be made to lie on the
bed, but fly off again.</p>

<p>&quot;Again, Caleb Powell came in, and, being affected to see our
trouble, did promise me and my wife, that, if we would be
willing to let him keep the boy, we should see ourselves
that we should be never disturbed while he was gone with
him: he had the boy, and had been quiet ever since.</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Tho. Rogers</span> and <span class="smcap">George Hardy</span>, being at
William Morse his house, affirm that the earth in the
chimney-corner moved, and scattered on them; that Tho.
Rogers was hit with somewhat, Hardy with an iron ladle as is
supposed. Somewhat hit William Morse a great blow, but it
was so swift that they could not certainly tell what it was;
but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[i.444]</a></span> looking down after they heard the noise, they saw a
shoe. The boy was in the corner at the first, afterwards in
the house.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> on Saturday testifieth that a board
flew against his chair, and he heard a noise in another
room, which he supposed in all reason to be diabolical.</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">John Dole</span> saw a pine stick of candlewood to fall
down, a stone, a firebrand; and these things he saw not what
way they came, till they fell down by him.</p>

<p>&quot;The same affirmed by John Tucker: the boy was in one
corner, whom they saw and observed all the while, and saw no
motion in him.</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Elizabeth Titcomb</span> affirmeth that Powell said that
he could find the witch by his learning, if he had another
scholar with him: this she saith were his expressions, to
the best of her memory.</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Jo. Tucker</span> affirmeth that Powell said to him, he
saw the boy throw the shoe while he was at prayer.</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Jo. Emerson</span> affirmeth that Powell said he was
brought up under Norwood; and it was judged by the people
there, that Norwood studied the black art.</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">A further Testimony of William Morse and his
Wife</span>.&#8212;We saw a keeler of bread turn over against me,
and struck me, not any being near it, and so overturned. I
saw a chair standing in the house, and not anybody near: it
did often bow towards me, and so rise up again. My wife also
being in the chamber, the chamber-door did violently fly
together, not anybody being near it. My wife, going to make
a bed, it did move to and fro, not anybody being near it. I
also saw an iron wedge and spade was flying out of the
chamber on my wife, and did not strike her. My wife going
into the cellar, a drum, standing in the house, did roll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[i.445]</a></span>
over the door of the cellar; and, being taken up again, the
door did violently fly down again. My barn-doors four times
unpinned, I know not how. I, going to shut my barn-door,
looking for the pin,&#8212;the boy being with me, as I did
judge,&#8212;the pin, coming down out of the air, did fall down
near to me. Again, Caleb Powell came in, as beforesaid, and,
seeing our spirits very low by the sense of our great
affliction, began to bemoan our condition, and said that he
was troubled for our afflictions, and said that he had eyed
this boy, and drawed near to us with great compassion: 'Poor
old man, poor old woman! this boy is the occasion of your
grief; for he hath done these things, and hath caused his
good old grandmother to be counted a witch.' 'Then,' said I,
'how can all these things be done by him?' Said he,
'Although he may not have done all, yet most of them; for
this boy is a young rogue, a vile rogue: I have watched him,
and see him do things as to come up and down.' Caleb Powell
also said he had understanding in astrology and astronomy,
and knew the working of spirits, some in one country, and
some in another; and, looking on the boy, said, 'You young
rogue, to begin so soon. Goodman Morse, if you be willing to
let me have this boy, I will undertake you shall be free
from any trouble of this kind while he is with me.' I was
very unwilling at the first, and my wife; but, by often
urging me, till he told me whither, and what employment and
company, he should go, I did consent to it, and this was
before Jo. Badger came; and we have been freed from any
trouble of this kind ever since that promise, made on Monday
night last, to this time, being Friday in the afternoon.
Then we heard a great noise in the other room, oftentimes,
but, looking after it, could not see any thing; but,
afterwards looking into the room, we saw a board hanged to
the press. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[i.446]</a></span> we, being by the fire, sitting in a chair,
my chair often would not stand still, but ready to throw me
backward oftentimes. Afterward, my cap almost taken off my
head three times. Again, a great blow on my poll, and my cat
did leap from me into the chimney corner. Presently after,
this cat was thrown at my wife. We saw the cat to be ours:
we put her out of the house, and shut the door. Presently,
the cat was throwed into the house. We went to go to bed.
Suddenly,&#8212;my wife being with me in bed, the lamp-light by
our side,&#8212;my cat again throwed at us five times, jumping
away presently into the floor; and, one of those times, a
red waistcoat throwed on the bed, and the cat wrapped up in
it. Again, the lamp, standing by us on the chest, we said it
should stand and burn out; but presently was beaten down,
and all the oil shed, and we left in the dark. Again, a
great voice, a great while, very dreadful. Again, in the
morning, a great stone, being six-pound weight, did remove
from place to place,&#8212;we saw it,&#8212;two spoons throwed off the
table, and presently the table throwed down. And, being
minded to write, my inkhorn was hid from me, which I found,
covered with a rag, and my pen quite gone. I made a new pen;
and, while I was writing, one ear of corn hit me in the
face, and fire, sticks, and stones throwed at me, and my pen
brought to me. While I was writing with my new pen, my
inkhorn taken away: and, not knowing how to write any more,
we looked under the table, and there found him; and so I was
able to write again. Again, my wife her hat taken from her
head, sitting by the fire by me, the table almost thrown
down. Again, my spectacles thrown from the table, and thrown
almost into the fire by me, and my wife and the boy. Again,
my book of all my accounts thrown into the fire, and had
been burnt presently, if I had not taken it up. Again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[i.447]</a></span>
boards taken off a tub, and set upright by themselves; and
my paper, do what I could, hardly keep it while I was
writing this relation, and things thrown at me while
a-writing. Presently, before I could dry my writing, a
mormouth hat rubbed along it; but I held so fast that it did
blot but some of it. My wife and I, being much afraid that I
should not preserve it for public use, did think best to lay
it in the Bible, and it lay safe that night. Again, the
next, I would lay it there again; but, in the morning, it
was not there to be found, the bag hanged down empty; but,
after, was found in a box alone. Again, while I was writing
this morning, I was forced to forbear writing any more, I
was so disturbed with so many things constantly thrown at
me.</p>

<p>&quot;This relation brought in Dec. 8.</p>

<p>&quot;I, <span class="smcap">Anthony Morse</span>, occasionally being at my brother
Morse's house, my brother showed me a piece of a brick which
had several times come down the chimney. I sitting in the
corner, I took the piece of brick in my hand. Within a
little space of time, the piece of brick was gone from me, I
knew not by what means. Quickly after, the piece of brick
came down the chimney. Also, in the chimney-corner I saw a
hammer on the ground: there being no person near the hammer,
it was suddenly gone, by what means I know not. But, within
a little space after, the hammer came down the chimney. And,
within a little space of time after that, came a piece of
wood down the chimney, about a foot long; and, within a
little after that, came down a firebrand, the fire being
out. This was about ten days ago.</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">John Badger</span> affirmeth, that, being at William
Morse his house, and heard Caleb Powell say that he thought
by astrology, and I think he said by astronomy too, with it,
he could find out whether or no there were diabolical means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[i.448]</a></span>
used about the said Morse his trouble, and that the said
Caleb said he thought to try to find it out.</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">The Deposition of Mary Tucker</span>, aged about
twenty.&#8212;She remembered that Caleb Powell came into her
house, and said to this purpose: That he, coming to William
Morse his house, and the old man, being at prayer, he
thought not fit to go in, but looked in at the window; and
he said he had broken the enchantment; for he saw the boy
play tricks while he was at prayer, and mentioned some, and,
among the rest, that he saw him to fling the shoe at the
said Morse's head.</p>

<p>&quot;Taken on oath, March 29, 1680, before me,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Jo: Woodbridge</span>, <i>Commissioner</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;Mary Richardson confirmed the truth of the above written
testimony, on oath, at the same time.&quot;</p></div>

<p>There seem to have been several hearings before Commissioner
Woodbridge. The boy had returned to his grandparents before the last
deposition of William Morse, and his audacious operations were
persisted in to the last. The final decision of the Court was as
follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Upon the hearing the complaint brought to this Court
against Caleb Powell for suspicion of working by the Devil
to the molesting of the family of William Morse of Newbury,
though this court cannot find any evident ground of
proceeding further against the said Caleb Powell, yet we
determine that he hath given such ground of suspicion of his
so dealing that we cannot so acquit him, but that he justly
deserves to bear his own share and the costs of the
prosecution of the complaint.</p>

<p>&quot;Referred to Mr. Woodbridge to examine and determine the
charges.&quot;</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[i.449]</a></span></p>

<p>The entry of this sentence, in the records of the County Court, is as
follows; the clerk strangely mistaking the name of the party:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;The Court held at Ipswich, the 30th of March, 1680.</p>

<p>&quot;In the case of Abell Powell, though the Court do not see
sufficient to charge further, yet find so much suspicion as
that he pay the charges. The ordering of the charges left to
Mr. Jo: Woodbridge.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The matter of Powell's connection with the affair being thus disposed
of, and no one seeming to entertain his idea of the guilt of the boy,
the next step was to fasten suspicion upon the good old grandmother;
and a general outcry was raised against her. Her arrest and
condemnation were clamored for. But the result of Powell's trial, and
all preceding cases, showed that an Essex jury could not yet be relied
on for a conviction in witchcraft cases; and it was resolved to
institute proceedings in a more favorable quarter. The Grand Jury
returned a bill of indictment against her to the Court of Assistants,
sitting in Boston. This was the highest tribunal in the country,
subject only to the General Court, and embracing the whole colony in
its jurisdiction. The following is the substance of the record of the
case:&#8212;</p>

<p>At a Court of Assistants, on adjournment, held at Boston, on the 20th
of May, 1680.</p>

<p>The Grand Jury having presented Elizabeth Morse, wife of William
Morse, she was tried and convicted of the crime of witchcraft. The
Governor, on the 27th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[i.450]</a></span> of May, &quot;after the lecture,&quot; in the First
Church of Boston, pronounced the sentence of death upon her. On the
1st of June, the Governor and Assistants voted to reprieve her &quot;until
the next session of the Court in Boston.&quot; At the said next session,
the reprieval was still further continued. This seems to have produced
much dissatisfaction, as is shown by the following extract from the
records of the House of Deputies:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;The Deputies, on perusal of the Acts of the Honored Court
of Assistants, relating to the woman condemned for
witchcraft, do not understand the reason why the sentence,
given against her by said Court, is not executed: and the
second reprieval seems to us beyond what the law will allow,
and do therefore judge meet to declare ourselves against it,
with reference to the concurrence of the honored magistrates
hereto.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">William Torrey</span>, <i>Clerk</i>.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The action of the magistrates, on this reference, is recorded as
follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;3d of November, 1680.&#8212;Not consented to by magistrates.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Edward Rawson</span>, Secretary.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The evidence against Mrs. Morse was frivolous to the last degree,
without any of the force and effect given to support the prosecutions
in Salem, twelve years afterwards, by the astounding confessions of
the accused, and the splendid acting of the &quot;afflicted children;&quot; yet
she was tried and condemned in Boston, and sentenced there on
&quot;Lecture-day.&quot; The representatives of the people, in the House of
Deputies, cried out against her reprieve. She was saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[i.451]</a></span> by the
courage and wisdom of Governor Bradstreet, subsequently a resident of
Salem, where his ashes rest. He was living here, at the age of ninety
years, during the witchcraft prosecutions in 1692; but, old as he was,
he made known his entire disapprobation of them. It is safe to say,
that, if he had not been superseded by the arrival of Sir William
Phipps as governor under the new charter, they would never have taken
place. Notwithstanding all this,&#8212;in spite of the remonstrances, at
the time, of Brattle, and afterwards of Hutchinson,&#8212;Boston and other
towns (earlier, if not equally, committed to such proceedings) have,
by a sort of general conspiracy, joined the rest of the world in
trying to throw and fasten the whole responsibility and disgrace of
witchcraft prosecutions upon Salem.</p>

<p>Things continued in the condition just described,&#8212;Mrs. Morse in jail
under sentence of death; that sentence suspended by reprieves from the
Governor, from time to time, until the next year, when her husband, in
her behalf and in her name, presented an earnest and touching petition
&quot;to the honored Governor, Deputy-governor, Magistrates, and Deputies
now assembled in Court, May the 18th, 1681,&quot; that her case might be
concluded, one way or another. After referring to her condemnation,
and to her attestation of innocence, she says, &quot;By the mercy of God,
and the goodness of the honored Governor, I am reprieved.&quot; She begs
the Court to &quot;hearken to her cry, a poor prisoner.&quot; She places herself
at the foot of the tribunal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[i.452]</a></span> of the General Court: &quot;I now stand humbly
praying your justice in hearing my case, and to determine therein as
the Lord shall direct. I do not understand law, nor do I know how to
lay my case before you as I ought; for want of which I humbly beg of
your honors that my request may not be rejected.&quot; The House of
Deputies, on the 24th of May, voted to give her a new trial. But the
magistrates refused to concur in the vote; and so the matter stood,
for how long a time there are, I believe, no means of knowing.
Finally, however, she was released from prison, and allowed to return
to her own house. This we learn from a publication made by Mr. Hale,
of Beverly, in 1697. It seems, that, after getting her out of prison
and restored to her home, to use Mr. Hale's words, &quot;her husband, who
was esteemed a sincere and understanding Christian by those that knew
him, desired some neighbor ministers, of whom I was one, to discourse
his wife, which we did; and her discourse was very Christian, and
still pleaded her innocence as to that which was laid to her charge.&quot;
From Mr. Hale's language, it may be inferred that she had not been
pardoned or discharged, but still lay under sentence of death, after
her removal to her own house: for he and his brethren did not &quot;esteem
it prudence to pass any definite sentence upon one under her
circumstances;&quot; but they ventured to say that they were &quot;inclined to
the more charitable side.&quot; Mr. Hale states, that, &quot;in her last
sickness, she was in much trouble and darkness of spirit, which
occasioned a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[i.453]</a></span> judicious friend to examine her strictly, whether she
had been guilty of witchcraft; but she said <i>no</i>, but the ground of
her trouble was some impatient and passionate speeches and actions of
hers while in prison, upon the account of her suffering wrongfully,
whereby she had provoked the Lord by putting contempt upon his Word.
And, in fine, she sought her pardon and comfort from God in Christ;
and died, so far as I understand, praying to and relying upon God in
Christ for salvation.&quot;</p>

<p>The cases of Margaret Jones, Ann Hibbins, and Elizabeth Morse
illustrate strikingly and fully the history and condition of the
public mind in New England, and the world over, in reference to
witchcraft in the seventeenth century. They show that there was
nothing unprecedented, unusual, or eminently shocking, after all, in
what I am about to relate as occurring in Salem, in 1692. The only
real offence proved upon Margaret Jones was that she was a successful
practitioner of medicine, using only simple remedies. Ann Hibbins was
the victim of the slanderous gossip of a prejudiced neighborhood; all
our actual knowledge of her being her Will, which proves that she was
a person of much more than ordinary dignity of mind, which was kept
unruffled and serene in the bitterest trials and most outrageous
wrongs which it is possible for folly and &quot;man's inhumanity to man&quot; to
bring upon us in this life. Elizabeth Morse appears to have been one
of the best of Christian women. The accusations against them, as a
whole, cover nearly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[i.454]</a></span> whole ground upon which the subsequent
prosecutions in Salem rested. John Winthrop passed sentence upon
Margaret Jones, John Endicott upon Ann Hibbins, and Simon Bradstreet
upon Elizabeth Morse. The last-named governor performed the office as
an unavoidable act of official duty, and prevented the execution of
the sentence by the courageous use of his prerogative, in defiance of
public clamor and the wrath of the representatives of the whole people
of the colony. These facts sufficiently show, that the proceedings
afterwards had in Salem accorded with those in like cases, of that and
preceding generations; and were sanctioned by the all but universal
sentiments of mankind and a uniform chain of precedents.</p>

<p>The trial of Bridget Bishop, in 1680, before the County Court at
Salem, for witchcraft, and her acquittal, have already been mentioned
in the account of Salem Village, in the <a href="#PART_FIRST">First Part</a>.</p>

<p>In 1688, an Irish woman, named Glover, was executed in Boston for
bewitching four children belonging to the family of a Mr. Goodwin. She
was a Roman Catholic, represented to have been quite an ignorant
person, and seems, moreover, from the accounts given of her, to have
been crazy. The oldest of the children was only about thirteen years
of age. The most experienced physicians pronounced them bewitched.
Their conduct, as it is related by Cotton Mather, was indeed very
extraordinary. At one time they would bark like dogs, and then again
they would purr like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[i.455]</a></span> cats. &quot;Yea,&quot; says he, &quot;they would fly like
geese, and be carried with an incredible swiftness, having but just
their toes now and then upon the ground, sometimes not once in twenty
feet, and their arms waved like the wings of a bird.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the children seems to have had a genius scarcely inferior to
that of Master Burke himself: there was no part nor passion she could
not enact. She would complain that the old Irish woman had tied an
invisible noose round her neck, and was choking her; and her
complexion and features would instantly assume the various hues and
violent distortions natural to a person in such a predicament. She
would declare that an invisible chain was fastened to one of her
limbs, and would limp about precisely as though it were really the
case. She would say that she was in an oven; the perspiration would
drop from her face, and she would exhibit every appearance of being
roasted: then she would cry out that cold water was thrown upon her,
and her whole frame would shiver and shake. She pretended that the
evil spirit came to her in the shape of an invisible horse; and she
would canter, gallop, trot, and amble round the rooms and entries in
such admirable imitation, that an observer could hardly believe that a
horse was not beneath her, and bearing her about. She would go up
stairs with exactly such a toss and bound as a person on horseback
would exhibit.</p>

<p>After some time, Cotton Mather took her into his own family, to see
whether he could not exorcise her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[i.456]</a></span> His account of her conduct, while
there, is highly amusing for its credulous simplicity. The cunning and
ingenious child seems to have taken great delight in perplexing and
playing off her tricks upon the learned man. Once he wished to say
something in her presence, to a third person, which he did not intend
she should understand. He accordingly spoke in Latin. But she had
penetration enough to conjecture what he had said: he was amazed. He
then tried Greek: she was equally successful. He next spoke in Hebrew:
she instantly detected the meaning. At last he resorted to the Indian
language, and that she pretended not to know. He drew the conclusion
that the evil being with whom she was in compact was acquainted
familiarly with the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, but not with the Indian
tongue.</p>

<p>It is curious to notice how adroitly she fell into the line of his
prejudices. He handed her a book written by a Quaker, to which sect it
is well known he was violently opposed: she would read it off with
great ease, rapidity, and pleasure. A book written against the Quakers
she could not read at all. She could read Popish books, but could not
decipher a syllable of the Assembly's Catechism. Dr. Mather was
earnestly opposed to the order and liturgy of the Church of England.
The artful little girl worked with great success upon this prejudice.
She pretended to be very fond of the Book of Common Prayer, and called
it her Bible. It would relieve her of her sufferings, in a moment, to
put it into her hands. While she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[i.457]</a></span> not read a word of the
Scriptures in the Bible, she could read them very easily in the
Prayer-book; but she could not read the Lord's Prayer even in this her
favorite volume. All these things went far to strengthen the
conviction of Dr. Mather that she was in league with the Devil; for
this was the only explanation that could be given to satisfy his mind
of her partiality to the productions of Quakers, Catholics, and
Episcopalians, and her aversion to the Bible and the Catechism.</p>

<p>She exhibited the most exquisite ingenuity in beguiling Dr. Mather by
the force of a charm, the power of which he could not resist for a
moment,&#8212;flattery. He thus describes, with a complacency but thinly
concealed under the veil of affected modesty, the part she played, in
order to give the impression&#8212;which it was the great object of his
ambition to make upon the public mind&#8212;that the Devil stood in special
fear of his presence:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;There then stood open the study of one belonging to the
family, into which, entering, she stood immediately on her
feet, and cried out, 'They are gone! they are gone! They say
that they cannot,&#8212;God won't let 'em come here!' adding a
reason for it which the owner of the study thought more kind
than true; and she presently and perfectly came to herself,
so that her whole discourse and carriage was altered into
the greatest measure of sobriety.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Upon quitting the study, &quot;the demons&quot; would instantly again take hold
of her. Mather continues the statement, by saying that some persons,
wishing to try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[i.458]</a></span> the experiment, had her brought &quot;up into the study;&quot;
but he says that she at once became&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;so strangely distorted, that it was an extreme difficulty
to drag her up stairs. The demons would pull her out of the
people's hands, and make her heavier than, perhaps, three of
herself. With incredible toil (though she kept screaming,
'They say I must not go in'), she was pulled in; where she
was no sooner got, but she could stand on her feet, and,
with altered note, say, 'Now I am well.' She would be faint
at first, and say 'she felt something to go out of her' (the
noises whereof we sometimes heard like those of a mouse);
but, in a minute or two, she could apply herself to
devotion. To satisfy some strangers, the experiment was,
divers times, with the same success, repeated, until my
lothness to have any thing done like making a charm of a
room, caused me to forbid the repetition of it.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Even in her most riotous proceedings, she kept her eye fixed upon the
doctor's weak point. When he called the family to prayers, she would
whistle and sing and yell to drown his voice, would strike him with
her fist, and try to kick him. But her hand or foot would always
recoil when within an inch or two of his body; thus giving the idea
that there was a sort of invisible coat of mail, of heavenly temper,
and proof against the assaults of the Devil, around his sacred person!
After a while, Dr. Mather concluded to prepare an account of these
extraordinary circumstances, wherewithal to entertain his congregation
in a sermon. She seemed to be quite displeased at the thought of his
making public the doings of her master, the Evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[i.459]</a></span> One, attempted to
prevent his writing the intended sermon, and disturbed and interrupted
him in all manner of ways. For instance, she once knocked at his study
door, and said that &quot;there was somebody down stairs that would be glad
to see him.&quot; He dropped his pen, and went down. Upon entering the
room, he found nobody there but the family. The next time he met her,
he undertook to chide her for having told him a falsehood. She denied
that she had told a falsehood. &quot;Didn't you say,&quot; said he, &quot;that there
was somebody down stairs that would be glad to see me?&quot;&#8212;&quot;Well,&quot; she
replied, with inimitable pertness, &quot;is not Mrs. Mather always glad to
see you?&quot;</p>

<p>She even went much farther than this in persecuting the good man while
he was writing his sermon: she threw large books at his head. But he
struggled manfully against these buffetings of Satan, as he considered
her conduct to be, finished the sermon, related all these
circumstances in it, preached, and published it. Richard Baxter wrote
the preface to an edition printed in London, in which he declares that
he who will not be convinced by all the evidence Dr. Mather presents
that the child was bewitched &quot;must be a very obdurate Sadducee.&quot; It is
so obvious, that, in this whole affair, Cotton Mather was grossly
deceived and audaciously imposed upon by the most consummate and
precocious cunning, that it needs no comment. I have given this
particular account of it, because there is reason to believe that it
originated the delusion in Salem. It occurred only four years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[i.460]</a></span> before.
Dr. Mather's account of the transaction filled the whole country; and
it is probable that the children in Mr. Parris's family undertook to
re-enact it.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the annals of the histrionic art more illustrative
of the infinite versatility of the human faculties, both physical and
mental, and of the amazing extent to which cunning, ingenuity,
contrivance, quickness of invention, and presence of mind can be
cultivated, even in very young persons, than such cases as this just
related. It seems, at first, incredible that a mere child could carry
on such a complex piece of fraud and imposture as that enacted by the
little girl whose achievements have been immortalized by the famous
author of the &quot;Magnalia.&quot; Many other instances, however, are found
recorded in the history of the delusion we are discussing.</p>

<p>That of the grandchild of William and Elizabeth Morse, in Newbury, was
nearly as marvellous, and perfectly successful in deceiving the whole
country except Caleb Powell; and he got into much trouble in
consequence of seeing through it. A similar instance of juvenile
imposture is related as having occurred at Amsterdam in 1560. Twenty
or thirty boys pretended to be suddenly seized with a kind of rage and
fury, were cast upon the ground, and tormented with great agony. These
fits were intermittent; and, when they had passed off, their subjects
did not seem to be conscious of what had taken place. While they
lasted, the boys threw up, apparently from their stomachs, large
quantities of needles, pins, thimbles, pieces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[i.461]</a></span> cloth, fragments of
pots and kettles, bits of glass, locks of hair, and a variety of other
articles. There was no doubt, at the time, that they were suffering
under the influence of the Devil; and multitudes crowded round them,
and gazed upon them with wonder and horror.</p>

<p>The details of the cases in Newbury and Charlestown were dressed up by
Cotton Mather and other writers in the strongest colors that credulous
superstition and the peculiar views of that age on the subject of
demonology could employ. They were almost universally received as
proof that Satan had commenced an onslaught, such as had never before
been known, upon the Church and the world! They appear to us as simply
absurd, and the result of precocious knavery; not so to the people of
that generation. They were looked upon as fearful demonstrations of
diabolical power, and preludes to the coming of Satan, with his
infernal confederates, to overwhelm the land. The imaginations of all
were excited, and their apprehensions morbidly aroused. The very air
was filled with rumors, fancies, and fears. The ministers sounded the
alarm from their pulpits. The magistrates sharpened the sword of
justice. The deputy-governor of the colony, Danforth, began to arrest
suspected persons months before proceedings commenced, or were thought
of, in Salem Village. It was believed that evil spirits had been seen,
by men's bodily eyes, in a neighboring town. They glided over the
fields, hovered around the houses, appeared, van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[i.462]</a></span>ished, and
re-appeared on the outskirts of the woods, in the vicinity of
Gloucester. Their movements were observed by several of the
inhabitants; and the whole population of the Cape was kept in a state
of agitation and alarm, in consequence of the mysterious phenomena,
for three weeks. The inhabitants retired to the garrison, and put
themselves in a state of defence against the diabolical besiegers.
Sixty men were despatched from Ipswich, in military array, to
re-enforce the garrison, and several valiant sallies were made from
its walls. Much powder was expended, but no corporeal or incorporeal
blood was shed. An account of these events was drawn up by the Rev.
John Emerson, then the minister of the first parish in Gloucester,
from which the facts now mentioned have been selected. It is very
minute and particular. The appearance and dress of the supernatural
enemies are described. They wore white waistcoats, blue shirts, and
white breeches, and had bushy heads of black hair. Mr. Emerson
concludes his account by expressing the hope that &quot;all rational
persons will be satisfied that Gloucester was not alarmed last summer
for above a fortnight together by real French and Indians, but that
the Devil and his agents were the cause of all the molestation which
at this time befell the town.&quot;</p>

<p>These wonderful things took place at Cape Ann, about the time that the
great conflict between the Devil and his confederates on the one hand,
and the ministers and magistrates on the other, at Salem Village, was
reaching its height. It is said that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[i.463]</a></span> regarded by the most
considerate persons, at the time, as an artful contrivance of the
Devil to create a diversion of the attention of the pious colonists
from his operations through the witches in Salem, and, by dividing and
distracting their forces, to obtain an advantage over them in the war
he was waging against their churches and their religion.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We are now ready to enter upon the story of Salem witchcraft. We have
endeavored to become acquainted with the people who acted conspicuous
parts in the drama, and to understand their character; and have tried
to collect, and bring into appreciating view, the opinions and
theories, the habits of thought, the associations of mind, the
passions, impulses, and fantasies that guided, moulded, and controlled
their conduct. The law, literature, and theology of the age, as they
bore on the subject, have been brought before us. The last great
display of the effects of the doctrines of demonology, of the belief
of the agency of invisible, irresponsible beings, whether fallen
angels or departed spirits, upon the actions of men and human affairs,
is now to open before us. The final results of superstitions and
fables and fancies, accumulating through the ages, are to be exhibited
in a transaction, an actual demonstration in real life. They are to
present an exemplification that will at once fully display their
power, and deal their death-blow.</p>

<p>Without the least purpose or wish to cover up or extenuate the
follies, excesses, or outrages I am about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[i.464]</a></span> to describe, into which the
community suffered itself to be led in the witchcraft proceedings of
1692,&#8212;with a desire, on the contrary, to make the lesson then given
of the mischief resulting from misguided enthusiasm, and which will
always result when popular excitement is allowed to wield the
organized powers of society, as impressive as facts and truth will
justify,&#8212;I feel bound to say, in advance, that there are some
considerations which we must keep before us, while reviewing the
incidents of the transaction. The theological, legal, and
philosophical doctrines and the popular beliefs, on which it was
founded, have, as I have shown, led, in other countries and periods,
to similar, and often vastly more shameful, cruel, and destructive
results. But there was something in the affair, as it was developed
here, that has arrested the notice of mankind, and clothed it with an
inherent interest, beyond all other events of the kind that have
elsewhere or ever occurred.</p>

<p>The moral force engendered in the civilization planted on these
shores, and pervading the whole body of society, supplied a mightier
momentum, as it does to this day, and ever will, to the movement of
the people, acting in a mass and as a unit, than can anywhere else be
found. A population, invigorated by hardy enterprise, and the constant
exercise of all the faculties of freedom, and actuated throughout by
individual energy of character, must be mightier in motion than any
other people. Such a population multiplies tenfold its physical
forces, by the addition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[i.465]</a></span> moral and intellectual energies. The men
of the day and scene we are now to contemplate, however deluded, to
whatever extremities carried, were controlled by fixed, absolute,
sharply defined, and, in themselves, great ideas. They believed in
God. They also believed in the Devil. They bowed in an adoration that
penetrated their inmost souls, before the one as a being of infinite
holiness: they regarded the other as a being of an all but infinite
power of evil. They feared and worshipped God. They hated and defied
the Devil. They believed that Satan was waging war against Jehovah,
and that the conflict was for the dominion of the world, for the
establishment or the overthrow of the Church of Christ. The battle,
they fully believed, could have no other issue than the salvation or
the ruin of the souls of men. This was not, with them, a mere
technical, verbal creed. It was a deep-seated conviction, held
earnestly with a clear and distinct apprehension of its import, by
every individual mind. For this warfare, they put on the whole armor
of faith, rallied to the banner of the Most High, and met Satan face
to face. In this one great idea, a stern, determined, unflinching,
all-sacrificing people concentrated their strength. No wonder that the
conflict reached a magnitude which made it observable to the whole
country and all countries at the time, and will make it memorable
throughout all time. Those engaged in it, with this sentiment
absorbing their very souls, passed, for the time, out of the realm of
all other sentiments, and were insensible to all other
considera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[i.466]</a></span>tions. The nearer and dearer the relatives, the higher and
more conspicuous the persons, who, in their belief, were in league
with the Devil, the more profound the abhorrence of their crime, and
the determination to cut off and destroy them utterly. They believed
that Satan had, once before, &quot;against the throne and monarchy of God,
raised impious war and battle proud;&quot; and that for this he had been
cast out from &quot;heaven, with all his host of rebel angels;&quot; that he,
with his army of subordinate wicked spirits, was making a desperate
effort to retrieve his lost estate, by a renewed rebellion against
God; and they were determined to drive him, and all his confederates,
for ever from the confines of the earth. The humble hamlet of Salem
Village was felt to be the great and final battle-ground. However wild
and absurd this idea is now regarded, it was then sincerely and
thoroughly entertained, and must be taken into the account, in coming
to a just estimate of the character of the transaction, and of those
engaged in it.</p>

<p>One other thought is to be borne in mind, as we pass through the
scenes that are to be spread before us. The theology of Christendom,
at that time, so far as it relates to the power and agency of Satan
and demonology in general,&#8212;and this is the only point of view on
which I ever refer to theology in this discussion,&#8212;and the whole
fabric of popular superstitions founded upon it, had reached their
culmination. The beginning, middle, and close of the seventeenth
century, witnessed the greatest display of those supersti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[i.467]</a></span>tions, and
prepared the way for their final explosion. As the hour of their
dissolution was at hand, and they were doomed to vanish before the
light of science and education, to pass from the realm of supposed
reality into that of acknowledged fiction, it seems to have been
ordered that they should leave monuments behind them, from which their
character, elements, and features, and their terrible influence, might
be read and studied in all subsequent ages.</p>

<p>The ideas in reference to the agency and designs of the great enemy of
God and man, and all his subordinate hosts, witches, fairies, ghosts,
&quot;gorgons and hydras, and chimeras dire,&quot; &quot;apparitions, signs, and
prodigies,&quot; by which the minds of men had so long been filled, and
their fearful imaginations exercised, as they took their flight,
imprinted themselves, for perpetual remembrance, in productions which,
more than any works of mere human genius, are sure to live for ever.
They left their forms crystallized, with imperishable lineaments, in
the greatest of dramas and the greatest of epics. The plays of
Shakespeare, as the century opened, and the verse of Milton in its
central period, are their record and their picture.</p>

<p>But there was another shape and aspect in which it was pre-eminently
important to have their memory preserved; and that was their
application to life, their influence upon the conduct of men, the
action of tribunals, and the movements of society, and, in general,
their effects, when allowed full operation, upon human happiness and
welfare. This want was supplied, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[i.468]</a></span> the century terminated, by the
tragedy in real life, whose scenes are now to be presented in
<span class="smcap">Witchcraft at Salem Village</span>.</p>

<p>However strange it seems, it is quite worthy of observation, that the
actors in that tragedy, the &quot;afflicted children,&quot; and other witnesses,
in their various statements and operations, embraced about the whole
circle of popular superstition. How those young country girls, some of
them mere children, most of them wholly illiterate, could have become
familiar with such fancies, to such an extent, is truly surprising.
They acted out, and brought to bear with tremendous effect, almost all
that can be found in the literature of that day, and the period
preceding it, relating to such subjects. Images and visions which had
been portrayed in tales of romance, and given interest to the pages of
poetry, will be made by them, as we shall see, to throng the woods,
flit through the air, and hover over the heads of a terrified court.
The ghosts of murdered wives and children will play their parts with a
vividness of representation and artistic skill of expression that have
hardly been surpassed in scenic representations on the stage. In the
Salem-witchcraft proceedings, the superstition of the middle ages was
embodied in real action. All its extravagances, absurdities, and
monstrosities appear in their application to human experience. We see
what the effect has been, and must be, when the affairs of life, in
courts of law and the relations of society, or the conduct or feelings
of individuals, are suffered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[i.469]</a></span> be under the control of fanciful or
mystical notions. When a whole people abandons the solid ground of
common sense, overleaps the boundaries of human knowledge, gives
itself up to wild reveries, and lets loose its passions without
restraint, it presents a spectacle more terrific to behold, and
becomes more destructive and disastrous, than any convulsion of mere
material nature; than tornado, conflagration, or earthquake.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Not only the storms of two hundred and thirty years, but
the bolts of heaven, have beat in vain upon this mansion. The view
given of it in the <a href="#townsend">frontispiece</a> is from a sketch taken in winter. The
leafless branches of a tall elm at its western end are represented. At
noon on Saturday, July 28, 1866, during a violent thunder-storm, the
electric fluid seems to have passed down the tree, rending and tearing
some of its branches, and leaving its traces on the trunk. It flashed
into the house. It tore the roof, knocking away one corner, displacing
in patches the mortar that coated the old chimney top and sides,
hacking the edges of the brick-work, splitting off the side of an
extension to the building at the western end, entering a chamber at
that point, where two children were sitting at a window, and throwing
upon the floor, within two or three feet of them, a considerable
portion of the plastered ceiling. It then scattered all through the
apartments. What looked like perforations, as if made by shot or
pistol-balls, were found in many places; but there were no
corresponding marks on the opposite sides of the walls or partitions.
Portions of the paper-hangings were stripped off, and small slivers
ripped up from the floors. It struck the frames of looking-glasses,
cracking off small pieces of the wood, but only in one instance
breaking the mirror. It cut a velvet band by which one was hung; and
it was found on the floor, the mirror downward and unbroken, as if it
had been carefully laid there. In the attic, fragments of the old
gnarled and knotted rafters, of different lengths,&#8212;from four or five
feet to mere chips,&#8212;were scattered in quantities upon the floor, and
grooves made lengthwise along posts and implements of household use.
Large cracks were left in the wooden casings of some of the doors and
windows. A family of eight persons were seated around the
dinner-table. All were more or less affected. They were deprived for
the time of the use of their feet and ancles; were stunned, paralyzed,
and rendered insensible for a few moments by the shock; and felt the
effects, some of them, for a day or two in their lower limbs. In front
of each person at the table was a tall goblet, which had just been
filled with water. As soon as they were able to notice, they found the
water dripping on all sides to the floor, the whole table-cloth wet,
seven of the goblets entirely empty, the eighth half emptied, and not
one of them thrown over, or in the slightest manner displaced. The
whole house was filled with what seemed, to the sight and smell, to be
smoke; but no combustion, scorch, discoloration, or the least
indication of heat, could be found on any of the objects struck. The
building, in its thirteen rooms, from the garret to the ground-floor,
had been flooded with lightning; but, with all its inmates, escaped
without considerable or permanent injury.</p></div>

value and excellence. It was its perverted application to the

of the learning and philosophy of the middle ages. The reader will
perceive, that it is to the syllogism, as thus misapplied and

shows how loose and inaccurate he was in his description of events. It
also illustrates the tendency of the times to exaggerate, or to paint
in the highest colors, whatever was susceptible of being represented
as miraculous. There is no reason, however, to doubt that the facts
took place substantially as described in the text. The reader is
